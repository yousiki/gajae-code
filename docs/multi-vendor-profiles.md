# Choosing models in GJC: role-based profiles

A practical guide to picking models for GJC's roles, for every subscription situation — one vendor, two vendors, or the full multi-vendor set. It adds curated cross-vendor `profiles:` for `~/.gjc/agent/models.yml` and verified selector notes on top of the mechanism in [Model profiles](./models.md#model-profiles---mpreset). Everything here is **user config**; it complements the built-in `--mpreset` presets and overrides a built-in only when it shares its exact name.

> Selectors, prices, and "axis leaders" are catalog- and time-sensitive (observed 2026-06 on the current bundled catalog). Re-verify any selector with `gjc -p --no-session --no-tools --model <selector> "Reply OK"`.

## The five roles

`default` runs the main loop and most turns; `executor` / `architect` / `planner` / `critic` are the four bundled task agents, delegated only when the work calls for it.

| Role | What it optimizes for |
| --- | --- |
| `default` | tool-calling reliability + honesty (it routes — its quality bounds the whole system) |
| `executor` | real coding (SWE-bench Verified) |
| `planner` | reasoning + sequencing (GPQA / ARC-AGI-2) |
| `architect` | large-context + multimodal review |
| `critic` | independent adversarial review (different family from what it reviews) |

## Pick by what you subscribe to

| You have | Use |
| --- | --- |
| **One vendor** | the built-in preset for that vendor — `claude-opus` (Anthropic), `codex-{eco,medium,pro}` (OpenAI/Codex), `opencodego` (OpenCode Go), or a single-vendor flagship tier (`zai/glm-5.2`, `kimi-code/...`, `xiaomi/...`, `xai/grok-4.3`, `minimax-code/...`). These already map all five roles inside one vendor. |
| **Claude + Codex** | the built-in `opus-codex` (Claude main loop + Codex support roles). |
| **Three or more / all five** | the cross-vendor profiles below — each role on its axis leader, `critic` kept cross-family. |

The single guiding rule across all of these: **keep `default` on the strongest router you have** (Anthropic Opus when available). A weak `default` caps quality regardless of the delegated models.

## Cross-vendor profiles (3+ vendors)

No single vendor leads every axis, so these put each role on its axis leader and keep `critic` on a different family from the `executor` it reviews.

```yaml
profiles:

  daily:                 # everyday balance
    required_providers: [anthropic, openai-codex, google-antigravity, xai]
    model_mapping:
      default:   anthropic/claude-opus-4-8:medium
      executor:  openai-codex/gpt-5.4:high
      planner:   google-antigravity/gemini-3.1-pro-low:high
      architect: google-antigravity/gemini-3.1-pro-low:high
      critic:    xai/grok-4.3:medium

  ultimate:              # cost-no-object, best per role
    required_providers: [anthropic, openai-codex, google-antigravity, xai]
    model_mapping:
      default:   anthropic/claude-opus-4-8:high
      executor:  anthropic/claude-opus-4-8:max
      planner:   openai-codex/gpt-5.5:xhigh
      architect: google-antigravity/gemini-3.1-pro-low:high
      critic:    xai/grok-4.3:high

  eco:                   # cheapest delegated work; main loop stays on Opus
    required_providers: [anthropic, opencode-go, google-antigravity, xai]
    model_mapping:
      default:   anthropic/claude-opus-4-8:low
      executor:  opencode-go/deepseek-v4-flash
      planner:   xai/grok-4-1-fast:high
      architect: google-antigravity/gemini-3.1-pro-low
      critic:    google-antigravity/gemini-3.5-flash

  monorepo:              # huge codebases (openai-codex excluded: 272k context cap)
    required_providers: [anthropic, google-antigravity, opencode-go]
    model_mapping:
      default:   anthropic/claude-opus-4-8:medium
      executor:  anthropic/claude-opus-4-8:high
      planner:   google-antigravity/gemini-3.1-pro-low:high
      architect: anthropic/claude-opus-4-8:high
      critic:    opencode-go/glm-5.2
```

## Model cheatsheet (by need)

Current axis leaders and the cheaper second option, with metered price ($/1M in/out; Gemini via Antigravity runs on the Google AI subscription):

| Need | First pick | Cheaper option |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Router / tool-calling (`default`) | `anthropic/claude-opus-4-8` (5/25) | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6` (3/15) |
| Coding (`executor`) | `anthropic/claude-opus-4-8` — SWE-bench Verified ~88.6 (5/25) | `openai-codex/gpt-5.4` (2.5/15) · `opencode-go/deepseek-v4-flash` (0.14/0.28) |
| Reasoning (`planner`) | `openai-codex/gpt-5.5` (ARC-AGI-2) / `google-antigravity/gemini-3.1-pro-low:high` (GPQA) | `xai/grok-4-1-fast` (0.2/0.5) |
| Large context (`architect`) | `anthropic/claude-opus-4-8` (effective long-context) | `xai/grok-4-fast` (2M nominal, 0.2/0.5) |
| Multimodal review (`architect`) | `google-antigravity/gemini-3.1-pro-low:high` | `google-antigravity/gemini-3.5-flash` |
| Independent critic | `xai/grok-4.3` (1.25/2.5) | `opencode-go/glm-5.2` · `google-antigravity/gemini-3.5-flash` |

On standard tasks, all current frontier models in the catalog are accurate; **pick by cost, latency, and role fit, not by raw accuracy on easy prompts.** As an indicative GJC-routed latency reference (`gjc -p`, identical coding + reasoning prompts, all correct): `grok-4.3` and `glm-5.2` ≈ 2–3s, `deepseek-v4-pro` ≈ 3–4s, `claude-opus-4-8` / `gpt-5.5` ≈ 4–7s, `gemini-3.1-pro-low:high` ≈ 7s.

## Verified selector notes (current catalog)

Observed via live `gjc -p` calls; useful when wiring the profiles above:

- **Antigravity Gemini, high reasoning** → use `google-antigravity/gemini-3.1-pro-low:high`. The id `gemini-3.1-pro-high` returns HTTP 400 (no matching backend model); `thinkingLevel` is a per-request parameter, so raising it on `gemini-3.1-pro-low` invokes the model's native high-reasoning mode rather than a degraded one.
- **openai-codex on a ChatGPT account** serves base GPT only (`gpt-5.5`, `gpt-5.4`). Standalone `-codex` variants (`gpt-5.3-codex`, `gpt-5.2-codex`, `gpt-5.1-codex-max` / `-mini`) return `not supported when using Codex with a ChatGPT account`.
- **Single-message input limit is separate from the context window.** `claude-opus-4-8` runs with a 1M window via multi-turn accumulation, but a single `@file` message above ~400k tokens returns 400 on `anthropic` / `google-antigravity`; `xai` / `opencode-go` accept larger single messages. Chunk very large inputs across turns instead of pasting one block.
- **Some selectors come from a provider's live catalog, not the bundled snapshot.** `opencode-go/glm-5.2` and `google-antigravity/gemini-3.5-flash` resolved in `gjc -p` tests but are **not** in `packages/ai/src/models.json`; they appear only after the provider's online model discovery has populated the registry. `required_providers` verifies credentials at activation — it does **not** guarantee fresh, non-stale discovery — so activation can still fail with `selector did not resolve` until discovery runs (re-login or retry to refresh). If you hit that, substitute a bundled id: `opencode-go/deepseek-v4-pro` for the critic, or `zai/glm-5.2` (add `zai` to `required_providers`) for GLM 5.2.

## Activation

```bash
gjc --mpreset daily               # this session only
gjc --mpreset ultimate --default  # persist as the startup default (config.yml)
```

Activation hard-blocks when any provider in `required_providers` lacks credentials, so log in first: `/login anthropic`, `/login openai-codex`, `/login google-antigravity`, `/login xai` (and `opencode-go` via `OPENCODE_API_KEY`).
