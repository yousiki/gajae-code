# Aside sidecar evaluation

This note records the safe first-step boundary for evaluating [Aside](https://aside.com/) with Gajae-Code (`gjc`). It is intentionally docs-only: GJC does not ship an Aside adapter, does not auto-discover Aside, and does not enable browser-control behavior by default.

## Current public surface

Official Aside docs currently describe Aside as a browser agent that can run tasks across websites, accounts, browsing history, files, saved credentials, and browser state. The developer surface includes:

- `aside "..."` for starting a browser task from the terminal.
- `aside --session <session-id> "..."` for continuing a task.
- `aside mcp` for exposing Aside to another agent or coding tool as an MCP server.
- `aside repl` for direct browser automation REPL tasks.

Those are useful evaluation hooks, but they are not a narrow GJC-native search API. The documented Aside product surface is broader than search/context retrieval, including browser actions, login-adjacent flows, files, payments, messages, and internal websites. GJC therefore treats Aside as an external, user-owned sidecar until a separate design approves a smaller protocol contract.

## Supported GJC boundary

Use Aside with GJC only when the user explicitly configures it. The safe default scope is:

- search, source-heavy research, summarization, and context retrieval;
- read-only inspection prompts where possible;
- explicit user-provided endpoint, command, and credentials;
- no raw browser/session/private payloads in logs, PRs, issues, or support bundles.

Out of scope by default:

- browser actions and form submissions;
- login flows, credential autofill, MFA, account recovery, and password-manager operations;
- payments, purchases, subscriptions, billing changes, posts, messages, or destructive actions;
- internal-tool workflows, customer/admin dashboards, or privileged production data;
- file writes or local computer control through Aside;
- automatic import of Aside browser history, cookies, task transcripts, screenshots, or local profile data into GJC.

If a task needs any out-of-scope behavior, stop and require a separate explicit design and approval path. Do not smuggle that behavior through a generic “search” tool name.

## Option A: local Aside MCP command

When the Aside CLI is installed and the operator intentionally wants GJC to see the Aside MCP tools, register the MCP server explicitly:

```sh
gjc mcp add aside aside mcp --project
```

Use `--project` for repo-local evaluation. Omit it only when the operator wants the server available to all local GJC sessions.

After registration, inspect the redacted definition:

```sh
gjc mcp list --json
```

Do not paste task transcripts, browser screenshots, cookies, saved credential state, or private Aside profile paths into issues or PRs. If you need to share evidence, summarize the tool list and a benign query result.

Recommended prompt boundary for evaluation:

```text
Use the Aside sidecar only for read-only search/context retrieval. Do not click, submit, sign in, autofill credentials, use payment or billing flows, post messages, write files, or operate internal tools. Return a short answer with source titles/URLs only.
```

## Option B: future HTTP/SSE MCP endpoint

If Aside or a wrapper later exposes a narrow search/context MCP endpoint, keep endpoint and credentials user-owned:

```sh
export ASIDE_MCP_URL="https://aside.example.invalid/mcp"
export ASIDE_API_KEY="..."
gjc mcp add aside-search --type http --url "$ASIDE_MCP_URL" --header Authorization="Bearer $ASIDE_API_KEY" --project
```

`gjc mcp list` and `gjc mcp remove` redact header/auth values, but operators are still responsible for not echoing secrets in shell history, CI logs, screenshots, or copied terminal output. Prefer environment indirection over literals whenever possible.

A future Aside search endpoint should be accepted only if it is narrower than browser automation. Minimum shape:

- one or more read-only search/context tools;
- no browser click/type/navigation tool in the same registered server unless explicitly approved;
- no direct access to cookies, saved credentials, raw screenshots, raw task transcripts, or browser profile paths;
- bounded response sizes with source titles/URLs and short snippets by default;
- clear auth failure vs endpoint/network failure errors without dumping request headers or private response bodies.

## Benign smoke checklist

Use this checklist instead of a live login/payment/internal-site scenario:

1. Register the MCP server with `gjc mcp add ... --project`.
2. Run `gjc mcp list --json` and confirm secrets are redacted.
3. Start a GJC session in a disposable repo/worktree.
4. Ask one public, non-personal query, for example: `Find the Aside public help page that describes MCP support and summarize the documented command names.`
5. Confirm the response includes only public page titles/URLs or short snippets.
6. Confirm no API key, Authorization header, cookie, browser profile path, screenshot, raw task transcript, or private session payload appears in terminal output, logs, issue comments, or PR text.
7. Remove the evaluation server if it is no longer needed:

```sh
gjc mcp remove aside --project
# or
gjc mcp remove aside-search --project
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
| --- | --- |
| `aside` command not found | Install the Aside CLI from Aside developer settings, then use the concrete CLI path as the MCP `command` if needed. |
| MCP server does not appear | Re-run `gjc mcp list --json`; confirm whether the registration was user-scoped or project-scoped. |
| Auth failure | Rotate or re-enter the Aside-side token/API key. Do not paste it into GJC prompts or issue comments. |
| Endpoint/network failure | Check the URL, proxy, and TLS path outside GJC with a benign health check; do not dump request headers. |
| Retrieval misses context | Narrow the query to public sources first. Do not add browser history, cookies, screenshots, or account pages unless a separate approved design covers that data flow. |
| Tool list includes browser actions | Treat the server as browser automation, not search-only. Keep it disabled for default GJC workflows unless an operator explicitly approves that broader sidecar for the session. |

## Decision

Docs-only is the smallest safe outcome for issue #1097. Existing GJC MCP registration can connect to a user-provided Aside MCP server, and Aside already documents `aside mcp`; no GJC adapter glue is required. The future-safe boundary is to keep Aside external and opt-in, document read/search/context-only use, and require a separate design before GJC claims support for browser actions, login, payment, internal-tool, or private browser-session workflows.
