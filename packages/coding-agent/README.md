## External lifecycle notifications

GJC already exposes public lifecycle events through the extension/hook event contract. External notification integrations for Discord, Hermes, clawhip, or similar channels should be opt-in and subscribe to these events instead of scraping transcripts or logs:

- `turn_end` — a model/tool turn finished. The public payload is `{ type: "turn_end", turnIndex, message, toolResults }`.
- `agent_end` — the agent loop for a submitted prompt reached a terminal boundary. The public payload is `{ type: "agent_end", messages }`.

For simple local side effects that do not need a full extension, set the user-level `completion.notifyCommand`. GJC runs it on completed agent turns with `GJC_NOTIFICATION_*` environment variables (`GJC_NOTIFICATION_TITLE`, `GJC_NOTIFICATION_BODY`, `GJC_NOTIFICATION_JSON`, etc.); project settings cannot activate this command hook.

```sh
gjc config set completion.notifyCommand 'cmux notify --title "$GJC_NOTIFICATION_TITLE" --body "$GJC_NOTIFICATION_BODY"'
```

`cmux notify` returning successfully means GJC handed the completion event to cmux. cmux may still suppress the native desktop banner when the app/window is focused, the emitting workspace is active, or the notification panel is open. In those cases, check cmux's notification panel or unread workspace state instead of treating the missing banner as a GJC delivery failure.

Recommended external mapping:

| Notification | Public event | Status guidance |
|---|---|---|
| Turn finished | `turn_end` | Use the handler's own sanitized status such as `"finished"`. |
| Agent stopped/finished | `agent_end` | Treat as terminal for the prompt. |
| Waiting/blocked/failed | `agent_end` plus a caller-supplied safe summary | Current lifecycle events do not expose a separate structured waiting/blocked reason; inspect only public-safe, integration-owned state. |

Forward only a minimal, caller-sanitized payload. Do not include raw prompts, assistant transcripts, hidden prompts, tool outputs, raw logs, host paths, private config, webhook URLs, channel IDs, tokens, or secrets. A safe notification payload should be built by the extension/hook itself, for example:

```ts
import type { ExtensionAPI } from "@gajae-code/coding-agent";

type PublicLifecycleNotification = {
	type: "turn_end" | "agent_end";
	status: "finished" | "stopped" | "failed" | "blocked" | "waiting";
	turnIndex?: number;
	timestamp: string;
	summary: string;
};

export default function lifecycleNotifier(pi: ExtensionAPI) {
	const enabled = process.env.GJC_LIFECYCLE_NOTIFY === "1";
	if (!enabled) return;

	const send = async (payload: PublicLifecycleNotification) => {
		// POST to Discord/Hermes/clawhip here. Keep target URLs and channel IDs in
		// private config or environment variables; never include them in payloads.
	};

	pi.on("turn_end", event =>
		send({
			type: "turn_end",
			status: "finished",
			turnIndex: event.turnIndex,
			timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
			summary: "GJC turn finished",
		}),
	);

	pi.on("agent_end", () =>
		send({
			type: "agent_end",
			status: "stopped",
			timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
			summary: "GJC prompt reached a terminal lifecycle boundary",
		}),
	);
}
```

This is the supported repo-native lifecycle notification path. It is not Claude Code hook compatibility, and it remains disabled unless the user configures an extension/hook handler and private delivery target.

## Memory backends

The agent supports three mutually-exclusive memory backends, selected via the `memory.backend` setting (Settings → Memory tab, or `~/.gjc/agent/config.yml`):

- `off` (default) — no memory subsystem runs.
- `local` — existing rollout-summarisation pipeline; writes `memory_summary.md` and consolidated artifacts under the agent dir.
- `hindsight` — talks to a [Hindsight](https://hindsight.vectorize.io) server (Cloud or self-hosted Docker). Hindsight uses private backend lifecycle hooks to retain transcripts and recall context; compatibility-only internals remain for legacy backend calls, but GJC does not expose public coding-harness memory tools such as `retain`, `recall`, or `reflect`.

### Hindsight quickstart

1. Run a Hindsight server (Cloud or `docker run -p 8888:8888 ghcr.io/vectorize-io/hindsight:latest`).
2. Set `memory.backend = "hindsight"` and `hindsight.apiUrl = "http://localhost:8888"` (or your Cloud URL).
3. Optional environment overrides (env wins over settings):
   - `HINDSIGHT_API_URL`, `HINDSIGHT_API_TOKEN` — connection
   - `HINDSIGHT_BANK_ID`, `HINDSIGHT_DYNAMIC_BANK_ID`, `HINDSIGHT_AGENT_NAME` — bank addressing
   - `HINDSIGHT_AUTO_RECALL`, `HINDSIGHT_AUTO_RETAIN`, `HINDSIGHT_RETAIN_MODE` — lifecycle
   - `HINDSIGHT_RECALL_BUDGET`, `HINDSIGHT_RECALL_MAX_TOKENS` — recall sizing
   - `HINDSIGHT_BANK_MISSION`, `HINDSIGHT_DEBUG`

Switching backends mid-session is honoured on the next system-prompt rebuild and the next `/memory` slash command. Existing users with `memories.enabled = true|false` are migrated to `memory.backend = "local"|"off"` exactly once on first launch.

## Red-claw TUI theme

The interactive TUI defaults to the bundled `red-claw` crustacean theme for dark terminals and the bundled `blue-crab` theme for light-appearance terminals, with matching welcome/icon assets. Three additional bundled migration themes — `claude-code`, `codex`, and `opencode` — mirror the look of those tools for easy eye-migration and are selectable from Settings or `/theme`. Explicit user theme settings still win; set `theme.dark: red-claw` and `theme.light: blue-crab` in `~/.gjc/agent/config.yml` to pin them.

### Welcome banner fonts on Windows Terminal

The startup logo defaults to rounded Unicode box drawing. Windows Terminal can render it correctly when the selected profile font has the needed box-drawing glyphs; recommended choices are `Cascadia Mono` or `Cascadia Mono Nerd Font`. In Windows Terminal Settings, set the profile font face to one of those fonts, or add it to the profile JSON:

```json
"font": {
  "face": "Cascadia Mono"
}
```

For terminals or fonts with broken rounded corners, set `startup.welcomeBannerMode` in `~/.gjc/agent/config.yml` to one of `unicode`, `square`, or `ascii`. `square` keeps a Unicode-looking logo using square corners (`┌ ┐ └ ┘`) while `ascii` uses only `+`, `-`, and `|`.
