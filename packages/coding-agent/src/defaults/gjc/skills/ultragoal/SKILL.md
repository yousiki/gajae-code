# Ultragoal Workflow

Use when the user asks for `ultragoal`, `create-goals`, `complete-goals`, durable multi-goal planning, or sequential execution over GJC goal mode.

## Purpose

`ultragoal` turns a brief into repo-native artifacts and then drives a GJC goal safely through the unified `goal` tool. New plans default to a stable pointer-style aggregate GJC goal for the whole durable plan in `.gjc/_session-{sessionid}/ultragoal/goals.json`, including later accepted/appended stories under the original brief constraints, while GJC tracks G001/G002 story progress in the ledger. Ultragoal does not require any `/goal` slash-command between runs. For back-to-back ultragoal runs in one session/thread, call `goal({"op":"drop"})` only when `goal({"op":"get"})` still reports an active aggregate; then call `goal({"op":"create"})`. The goal tool stays armed across drop so the next create works in-session, and no slash-command cleanup exists or is required.

- `.gjc/_session-{sessionid}/ultragoal/brief.md`
- `.gjc/_session-{sessionid}/ultragoal/goals.json`
- `.gjc/_session-{sessionid}/ultragoal/ledger.jsonl` (checkpoint and structured steering audit events)

Existing aggregate plans with the legacy enumerated objective are migrated to the stable pointer objective on read, persisted to `goals.json`, retained in `gjcObjectiveAliases` for already-active hidden goal reconciliation, and audited with an `aggregate_objective_migrated` ledger entry.

## Corrupt current-session state recovery

When ultragoal detects its own current-session state is corrupt, tampered, unreadable, or stale on resume, run `gjc state clear --force --mode ultragoal` before reseeding or restarting. Scope the clear to the current session via `--session-id`, the command payload, or `GJC_SESSION_ID`; it clears only ultragoal state for that session and never clears other skills or sessions.

## Always-used command examples

Use these exact `gjc ultragoal` commands before spending tool calls rediscovering syntax:

```sh
gjc ultragoal status
gjc ultragoal status --json
gjc ultragoal create-goals --brief "<brief>"
gjc ultragoal create-goals --brief-file <path>
gjc ultragoal complete-goals
gjc ultragoal complete-goals --retry-failed
gjc ultragoal checkpoint --goal-id <id> --status complete --evidence "<evidence>" --gjc-goal-json <goal-get-json-or-path> --quality-gate-json <quality-gate-json-or-path>
gjc ultragoal checkpoint --goal-id <id> --status failed --evidence "<blocker/evidence>"
gjc ultragoal record-review-blockers --goal-id <id> --title "Resolve final review blockers" --objective "<blocker-resolution objective>" --evidence "<review findings>" --gjc-goal-json <active-goal-get-json-or-path>
```

Use these exact goal-tool calls for the inline goal state:

```json
goal({"op":"get"})
goal({"op":"create","objective":"<printed aggregate or per-story objective>"})
goal({"op":"complete"})
goal({"op":"drop"})
goal({"op":"resume"})
```
`drop` clears the active goal without exiting goal mode; `resume` reactivates a paused goal.

Use `goal({"op":"get"})` snapshots inside Ultragoal for ledger reconciliation. The unified `goal` tool is the only agent-facing surface for goal state; no `/goal` subcommand is required.

## Create goals

1. Decide on the brief. To produce **multiple** stories, separate them with a reserved `@goal:` delimiter line; the title follows on the same line and the objective is everything beneath it until the next delimiter:

   ```text
   Shared brief constraints / context go here (optional preamble).

   @goal: Parse the intake CSVs
   Ingest reviewer CSVs from the watch dir, validate headers, and reject
   malformed rows with a per-row reason. Objectives can span multiple lines
   and contain `code`, "quotes", or commands — no escaping needed.

   @goal: Normalize records
   Map raw rows onto the canonical schema and dedupe by record id.

   @goal: Export the audit report
   Emit an audit-ready report covering every accepted and rejected row.
   ```

   Delimiter contract:
   - A `@goal` line is a story boundary **only** when it starts at column 0 (no leading whitespace) and the character right after `@goal` is `:`, whitespace (space or tab), or end-of-line. So `@goal: Title`, `@goal Title`, and a bare `@goal` line all open a story.
   - `@goalish`, `@goals:`, `@goal-foo`, `@goal.foo`, `@goal/foo`, and any indented or mid-line `@goal` are ordinary objective text, not delimiters. To keep a literal `@goal` line inside an objective, indent it.
   - A title-only block (no body) uses the title as its objective. An empty title borrows the first body line as the title. A block with **neither** title nor body is rejected — `create-goals` errors instead of writing a placeholder goal.
   - **Preamble** (any text before the first `@goal` delimiter) is global context/constraints only; it is retained in the brief but is **not** turned into a goal. Every executable story needs its own `@goal` block.
   - With **no** `@goal` delimiter anywhere, the whole brief becomes a single goal `G001` (unchanged legacy behavior).

   Stories become `G001`, `G002`, … in order.

2. Run one of:
   - `gjc ultragoal create-goals --brief "<brief>"`
   - `gjc ultragoal create-goals --brief-file <path>`
   - `cat <brief> | gjc ultragoal create-goals --from-stdin`
   - `gjc ultragoal create-goals --gjc-goal-mode per-story --brief "<brief>"` only when one GJC goal context per story is explicitly preferred
3. Inspect `.gjc/_session-{sessionid}/ultragoal/goals.json` and refine if needed.

## Complete goals

Loop until `gjc ultragoal status` reports all goals complete:

1. Run `gjc ultragoal complete-goals`.
2. Read the printed handoff.
3. Call `goal({"op":"get"})`.
4. If no active GJC goal exists, call `goal({"op":"create","objective":"<printed payload objective>"})` with the printed payload. In aggregate mode, if the same aggregate objective is already active, continue the current GJC story without creating a new GJC goal. If `goal({"op":"get"})` shows a stale dropped goal (status `"dropped"`) and a new aggregate must start, no extra cleanup is needed — `goal({"op":"create"})` succeeds directly. If a previous aggregate is still active and you genuinely need a fresh start in the same session, call `goal({"op":"drop"})` first, then `goal({"op":"create"})`.
5. Complete the current GJC story only.
6. Run a completion audit against the story objective and real artifacts/tests.
7. Before any `--status complete` checkpoint, run the mandatory final cleanup/review gate below. In aggregate mode, do **not** call `goal({"op":"complete"})` for intermediate stories; checkpoint each story with a fresh `goal({"op":"get"})` snapshot whose aggregate objective is still `active`. On the final story, use the same fresh active snapshot to create the final aggregate receipt first; only after that receipt exists may `goal({"op":"complete"})` run.
8. Checkpoint the durable ledger with that fresh active snapshot. Complete checkpoints require `--quality-gate-json`; the runtime hook rejects closure without a clean architect review:
   `gjc ultragoal checkpoint --goal-id <id> --status complete --evidence "<evidence>" --gjc-goal-json <goal-get-json-or-path> --quality-gate-json <quality-gate-json-or-path>`
   A successful complete checkpoint is story completion, not automatic run completion. Read the checkpoint output: when it prints `Next ultragoal goal: <id>`, continue that active story under the same aggregate GJC goal; when it prints `All ultragoal goals are complete`, the durable run is terminal. `gjc ultragoal complete-goals` remains the supported manual next-story command if continuation output was missed.
9. If blocked or failed, checkpoint failure:
   `gjc ultragoal checkpoint --goal-id <id> --status failed --evidence "<blocker/evidence>"`
10. For legacy per-story completed-goal blockers, preserve the non-terminal blocker with:
   `gjc ultragoal checkpoint --goal-id <id> --status blocked --evidence "<completed legacy GJC goal blocks goal create in this thread>" --gjc-goal-json <goal-get-json-or-path>`
11. Resume failed goals with `gjc ultragoal complete-goals --retry-failed`.

## Blocker triage and pause discipline

An active Ultragoal run must not give up on a blocker by pausing the goal and asking the user. Classify every blocker before deciding what to do, and default to `resolvable` when unsure:

- **`resolvable`** — anything the agent can act on: failing tests, missing implementation, a dependency to install, an ambiguous-but-inferable detail, investigation. **Never pause.** Exhaust autonomous resolution first: investigate, `gjc ultragoal steer --kind add_subgoal --title "Investigate blocker" --objective "..." --evidence "..." --rationale "..."`, delegate an `executor`, or preserve the blocker durably with `gjc ultragoal checkpoint --status blocked` / `gjc ultragoal record-review-blockers` and keep scheduling the next goal.
- **`human_blocked`** — only the user can act: credentials/secrets, a manual or physical step, an external approval/decision, access the agent lacks. Pause is the last resort and is gated.

`goal({"op":"pause"})` is **blocked at runtime** while an Ultragoal run is active unless the latest durable ledger event classifies the current blocker as `human_blocked`. To pause, record the classification immediately before pausing and cite the human-only dependency as evidence:

```sh
gjc ultragoal classify-blocker --classification human_blocked --evidence "<the specific human-only dependency>" [--goal-id <id>]
```

Recording `--classification resolvable` is an audit note only; it never authorizes a pause. The `ask` tool stays blocked during active runs regardless of classification — record unresolved decisions as durable blockers instead of prompting.

## Dynamic steering

Use `gjc ultragoal steer` when real findings or blockers prove the current story decomposition should change while the aggregate objective and constraints stay fixed. Steering is explicit-only and evidence-backed; broad natural-language requests are rejected instead of guessed.

Allowed mutation kinds are:

- `add_subgoal`
- `split_subgoal`
- `reorder_pending`
- `revise_pending_wording`
- `annotate_ledger`
- `mark_blocked_superseded`

Examples:

```sh
gjc ultragoal steer --kind add_subgoal --title "Investigate blocker" --objective "Validate the blocker and report evidence." --evidence "log/test output" --rationale "The blocker changes the safe execution order." --json
gjc ultragoal steer --kind split_subgoal --goal-id G002 --replacements-json '[{"title":"Fix parser","objective":"Resolve parser blocker."},{"title":"Verify parser","objective":"Run focused parser verification."}]' --evidence "Implementation split found two separable risks" --rationale "Splitting keeps each sub-goal independently verifiable." --json
gjc ultragoal steer --kind reorder_pending --order-json '["G003","G002"]' --evidence "Dependency order changed after investigation" --rationale "G003 must land before G002 can proceed safely." --json
gjc ultragoal steer --kind revise_pending_wording --goal-id G002 --title "Clarify blocker story" --evidence "The current title hides the actual blocker" --rationale "Clear wording keeps the ledger auditable." --json
gjc ultragoal steer --kind annotate_ledger --evidence "User changed release ordering at runtime" --rationale "The aggregate objective is unchanged, but the execution history needs an audit note." --json
gjc ultragoal steer --kind mark_blocked_superseded --goal-id G004 --evidence "The blocked work is no longer required because replacement evidence covers it" --rationale "No replacement sub-goal is needed; superseding only the blocked sub-goal unblocks final completion without changing the aggregate objective." --json
```

`--directive-json` and UserPromptSubmit structured steering are planned/deferred routing surfaces, not part of the native typed `--kind` CLI path described above.

Steering invariants:

- Do not edit the aggregate goal objective, original brief constraints, quality gates, or completion status. The aggregate objective is a stable pointer to `.gjc/_session-{sessionid}/ultragoal/goals.json` and `.gjc/_session-{sessionid}/ultragoal/ledger.jsonl`, not an enumeration of initial goal ids.
- Do not hard-delete goals, auto-complete work, weaken verification, or silently mutate `.gjc/_session-{sessionid}/ultragoal`.
- Accepted and rejected attempts append structured audit entries to `.gjc/_session-{sessionid}/ultragoal/ledger.jsonl`.
- Superseded goals remain in `goals.json` with steering metadata and are skipped for scheduling.
- Blocked goals without replacements are skipped for scheduling but still block final completion until later explicit steering replaces or supersedes them.

UserPromptSubmit structured steering directives are a planned/deferred routing surface. Normal prose does not mutate state.

## Role-agent delegation guidance

Ultragoal execution should use GJC's bundled role-agent roster when a durable story is large enough to benefit from delegation:

- Use `executor` for bounded implementation, refactoring, and fix slices.
- Use `planner` for story sequencing or handoff refinement when execution uncovers a missing plan branch.
- Use `architect` for read-only architecture and code-review lanes, including `CLEAR` / `WATCH` / `BLOCK` status.
- Use `critic` for read-only plan or handoff critique before execution proceeds.

When delegating with native subagents, an await timeout only limits the leader's wait. It is not subagent failure evidence and must not be used as a cancellation reason; inspect or continue independent work, and cancel only when the subagent has actually failed, gone off-track, or become unrecoverably wrong.

If an Ultragoal request has no approved plan or consensus artifact, run `ralplan` first and preserve its PRD, test spec, role roster, and verification guidance in the Ultragoal ledger. Do not silently substitute ad-hoc execution for missing planning.

The Ultragoal leader owns `.gjc/_session-{sessionid}/ultragoal/goals.json` and `.gjc/_session-{sessionid}/ultragoal/ledger.jsonl`. Role agents return implementation/review evidence; they do not checkpoint Ultragoal or mutate goal state.

For large subgoals with independent slices, the Ultragoal leader must spawn parallel `executor` subagents instead of doing serial solo work. Split only cleanly separable files/surfaces, give each executor bounded targets and acceptance criteria, and keep checkpoint ownership in the leader. Use `architect` / `critic` review lanes after integration; do not let worker agents mutate `.gjc/_session-{sessionid}/ultragoal` or call goal tools.

## Use Ultragoal and Team together

Use ultragoal and team together for a durable Ultragoal story that benefits from one visible tmux worker session. Ultragoal remains leader-owned: `.gjc/_session-{sessionid}/ultragoal/goals.json` stores the story plan and `.gjc/_session-{sessionid}/ultragoal/ledger.jsonl` stores checkpoints. Team is the single-worker tmux execution engine and returns task/evidence status to the leader.

The leader checkpoints Ultragoal from Team evidence with a fresh `goal({"op":"get"})` snapshot:

```sh
gjc ultragoal checkpoint --goal-id <id> --status complete --evidence "<team evidence mentioning .gjc/_session-{sessionid}/ultragoal and <id>>" --gjc-goal-json <fresh-goal-get-json-or-path> --quality-gate-json <quality-gate-json-or-path>
```

Workers do not own ultragoal goal state, do not create worker ultragoal ledgers, and do not checkpoint Ultragoal. Workers must not run `gjc ultragoal checkpoint`; checkpoint authority stays with the leader after worker tasks are terminal. Team launch remains explicit; Ultragoal does not auto-launch Team and performs no hidden goal mutation.

## Internal Ultragoal sub-skill fragments

The completion-gate cleanup sweep is driven by `ai-slop-cleaner`, an internal Ultragoal sub-skill bundled as a `kind: "skill-fragment"` prompt with parent skill `ultragoal` (installed at `skill-fragments/ultragoal/ai-slop-cleaner.md`). It is analogous to deep-interview's auto-research fragment: loaded on demand for one specific hook, never a user-facing skill.

- It is not slash-command discoverable, has no public skill-listing entry, and is never resolvable through `skill://`.
- It is a read-only detector+reporter over the active story's changed files only: it never edits code, writes files, mutates `.gjc/`, checkpoints, calls goal tools, or spawns workflows.
- It classifies every finding as blocking or advisory across the full taxonomy (fallback-like masking vs. grounded, duplication, dead code, needless abstraction, boundary violations, UI/design slop, missing tests).
- The leader and a leader-spawned `executor` own all fixes; the cleaner reruns until zero blocking findings remain. Advisory findings live in the gate report only.
- Recursion guard: it must not spawn nested `ralplan`/`team`/`deep-interview`/`ultragoal`; broad or architectural findings are handed back to the leader as review blockers.

## Mandatory completion cleanup and review gate

An ultragoal story cannot be checkpointed `complete` until the active agent has run the quality gate. The gate is plan-first, contract-driven, and surface-based:

1. Run targeted implementation verification for the story.
2. Run the internal ai-slop-cleaner skill fragment as the final cleanup sweep on the story's changed files only, before verification and red-team so only clean code is reviewed. It is a read-only detector that emits an `AI SLOP CLEANUP REPORT`; if there are no relevant edits it still runs and records a passed/no-op report. Every BLOCKING cleaner finding is a completion blocker: the leader spawns an `executor` to fix blocking findings only, then reruns the cleaner until blocking findings are zero. Advisory findings are included in the gate report only and are not written to the Ultragoal ledger. Carry the report through the existing `qualityGate.iteration.evidence` field; do not add a new top-level quality-gate key.
3. Rerun verification after the cleaner pass.
4. Delegate an `architect` review covering all three lanes:
   - architecture-side: system boundaries, layering, data/control flow, operational risks.
   - product-side: user-visible behavior, acceptance criteria, edge cases, regressions.
   - code-side: maintainability, tests, integration points, and unsafe shortcuts.
5. Delegate an `executor` QA/red-team lane to build and run the e2e/read-teaming QA suite appropriate for the story. This lane must try to break the change, not just confirm the happy path. It must start from the approved plan/spec/acceptance criteria, then user-facing contracts, and only then implementation code as supporting evidence. Plan/code mismatches are blockers, not items to paper over with implementation intent.
6. The executor QA/red-team lane must prove evidence by the real surface under test:
   - GUI/web surfaces require a valid automation transcript plus a non-uniform screenshot. Bare `inlineEvidence` text or typed receipts never prove live GUI/web execution.
   - CLI surfaces require runtime argv replay: `replaySafe: true`, an allowlisted argv `command`, and replayed normalized stdout matching `recordedStdout`. The conservative allowlist is intentionally small: `bun --version`, `node --version`, deterministic `bun/node -e "console.log(...)"`, `npm|pnpm|yarn --version`, `npm|pnpm|yarn list`, read-only `git status|rev-parse|merge-base|diff|show|log` with safe args, and `gjc read|status`. Unsafe, non-deterministic, credentialed, interactive, or otherwise unallowlisted commands require audited `replayExempt` metadata with exact fields `reasonCode`, `reason`, `approvedBy`, and `fallbackArtifactRefs` plus a structurally valid fallback artifact. Allowed `reasonCode` values are exactly `unsafe_side_effect`, `requires_credentials`, `requires_network`, `non_deterministic_external`, `destructive`, `interactive_only`, and `platform_unavailable`.
   - Native/desktop/tui surfaces require a structurally valid screenshot, PTY capture with terminal control codes, or app-automation transcript.
   - API/package surfaces require a real artifact file or typed receipt whose artifact `kind` contains one of `api`, `package`, `consumer`, `black-box`, or `test-report`; examples: `api-package-test-report`, `package-consumer-report`, `black-box-api-receipt`. Algorithm/math surfaces require a real artifact file or typed receipt whose artifact `kind` contains one of `property`, `boundary`, `edge`, `adversarial`, `failure`, `math`, `algorithm`, or `test-report`; examples: `property-test-report`, `algorithm-boundary-report`. Bare `inlineEvidence` text alone is not sufficient for any surface.
   - The mandatory **computer-use** red-team suite (`kill-switch-bypass`, `suspended-enforcement`, `permission-revoked`, …) is conditional, not universal: require it only when computer/desktop control is genuinely part of the product surface being dogfooded. For every other product type, prove the change through the matching live surface instead — browser-use automation for web/GUI, bash/CLI live invocation or argv replay for CLI, and real artifacts or typed receipts for API/package/algorithm/math. Editing docs, prompts, or skills that merely mention computer-use does not by itself make the computer-use suite applicable; pick the red-team surface that matches what the change actually ships.
7. The executor QA/red-team lane must report a matrix using `executorQa.contractCoverage`, `executorQa.surfaceEvidence`, `executorQa.adversarialCases`, and `executorQa.artifactRefs`. Not-applicable rows are allowed only in `contractCoverage` and `surfaceEvidence`; each `status: "not_applicable"` row requires `contractRef` plus `reason`. `adversarialCases` rows cannot be not-applicable.
8. Run a final code review pass and fold it into the strict quality gate. Clean means `architectReview.architectureStatus`, `architectReview.productStatus`, and `architectReview.codeStatus` are all `"CLEAR"`, `architectReview.recommendation` is `"APPROVE"`, executor QA statuses are `"passed"`, iteration is `"passed"` with `fullRerun: true`, every evidence field is non-empty, every required matrix row is present, and every blockers array is empty. `COMMENT`, `WATCH`, `REQUEST CHANGES`, `BLOCK`, missing evidence, missing or shallow matrix rows, plan/code mismatches, or non-empty blockers are non-clean.
9. If any lane finds an issue, do **not** checkpoint `complete` and do **not** call `goal({"op":"complete"})`. Record durable blocker work instead:
   ```sh
   gjc ultragoal record-review-blockers --goal-id <id> --title "Resolve verification blockers" --objective "<blocker-resolution objective>" --evidence "<architect/executor findings>" --gjc-goal-json <active-goal-get-json-or-path>
   ```
10. Complete or steer through the blocker story, then rerun the full blocking verification loop. Repeat until all verifier lanes are clean.
11. Only after the loop is clean, checkpoint the story as complete with a structured quality gate and a fresh active `goal({"op":"get"})` snapshot. The checkpoint creates a receipt; `goals.json.status` alone is not proof. In aggregate mode, the final aggregate receipt must exist before `goal({"op":"complete"})` is allowed.

While an Ultragoal run is active, the `ask` tool is blocked for all agents. Record unresolved review decisions as durable blockers with `gjc ultragoal record-review-blockers` instead of prompting interactively.

The native `checkpoint --status complete` command rejects missing or shallow gates. `--quality-gate-json` must include:

For CLI replay artifacts, the JSON at `path` must be an object like `{"schemaVersion":1,"kind":"cli-replay","replaySafe":true,"command":["bun","-e","console.log(\"ultragoal-cli-ok\")"],"recordedStdout":"ultragoal-cli-ok\n"}`. Use `replayExempt` only for audited unsafe/non-deterministic invocations, with exact fields `reasonCode`, `reason`, `approvedBy`, and `fallbackArtifactRefs`. `reason` must be substantive and audited, `approvedBy` must identify the verifier, and `fallbackArtifactRefs` must reference same-surface structurally valid fallback artifacts. Allowed `reasonCode` values are exactly `unsafe_side_effect`, `requires_credentials`, `requires_network`, `non_deterministic_external`, `destructive`, `interactive_only`, and `platform_unavailable`.

## Review mode

`gjc ultragoal review` runs the same hardened gate against an already implemented PR, branch, or worktree. Use `--pr <number>` for a PR, `--branch <ref>` for a branch diff, omit both for the current worktree, and pass `--spec <path>` when a real contract exists. `--mode review-only` emits the verdict/findings without creating fix work; `--mode review-start` records review blockers for follow-up. Review mode validates the same `executorQa` shape and live-surface artifacts as `checkpoint --status complete`. A thin or derived-only contract can never clean-pass: the verdict is capped at `inconclusive: weak-contract` until a supplied spec or equivalent strong acceptance criteria are available.

Receipts are freshness-scoped:
- Per-goal receipts remain fresh for their target goal unless that goal, its blocker metadata, or its supersession metadata changes.
- Normal later `goal_started` or clean receipt-backed `goal_checkpointed` events for other goals do not stale older per-goal receipts.
- Appending required goals or changing final required-goal state stales final aggregate receipts. Final aggregate completion requires a fresh final aggregate receipt proving no incomplete, blocked, or `review_blocked` required goals remain.

## Handoff back to planning

When the aggregate ultragoal is complete OR the user requests return to planning/clarification, mark ultragoal ready for handoff so the skill tool's chain guard permits the backward transition:

```
gjc state ultragoal write --input '{"current_phase":"handoff"}' --json
```

The skill tool then dispatches `/skill:ralplan` or `/skill:deep-interview` same-turn and runs `gjc state ultragoal handoff --to <ralplan|deep-interview> --json` in-process to atomically demote ultragoal, promote the callee, and sync both `.gjc/_session-{sessionid}/state/skill-active-state.json` files. You do not need to run the handoff verb yourself.

## Constraints

- The shell command emits a model-facing handoff for the active GJC agent; it does not invoke any `/goal` slash-command and the agent loop must not depend on any `/goal` subcommand.
- Use only the unified goal-tool surface from the agent loop: `goal({"op":"get"})`, `goal({"op":"create"})`, `goal({"op":"complete"})`, `goal({"op":"drop"})`, `goal({"op":"resume"})`. `drop` clears the active goal without exiting goal mode so the next `goal({"op":"create"})` works in-session. No slash-command cleanup exists or is required; Ultragoal never calls any `/goal` subcommand.
- For back-to-back ultragoal runs in the same session/thread, when `goal({"op":"get"})` still reports an active aggregate, call `goal({"op":"drop"})` before `goal({"op":"create"})`; when no active goal exists or the prior aggregate is already complete or dropped, call `goal({"op":"create"})` directly. The goal tool remains callable across drop; no slash-command cleanup exists or is required.
- Never call `goal({"op":"create"})` when `goal({"op":"get"})` reports a different active goal.
- Never call `goal({"op":"complete"})` unless the aggregate run or legacy per-story goal is actually complete.
- In aggregate mode, intermediate and final story checkpoints require a matching `active` GJC goal snapshot; the final story checkpoint creates the final aggregate receipt before `goal({"op":"complete"})` may reconcile the inline goal state.
- Completion checkpoints require read-only goal snapshot reconciliation: pass fresh `goal({"op":"get"})` JSON/path with `--gjc-goal-json`; shell commands and hooks must not mutate goal state.
- Treat `ledger.jsonl` as the durable audit trail; checkpoint after every success or failure.
