# Team Skill

`$team` is the tmux-based multi-worker execution mode for GJC. It starts real GJC worker CLI sessions by splitting the current tmux leader window and coordinates them through `.gjc/state/team/...` files plus CLI team interop (`gjc team api ...`) and state files.

This skill is operationally sensitive. Treat it as an operator workflow, not a generic prompt pattern. In GJC App or plain outside-tmux sessions, do not present `$team` / `gjc team` as directly available; launch GJC CLI from shell first, or stay on the nearest app-safe surface until the user explicitly wants the tmux runtime.

## Team vs Native Subagents

- Use **GJC native subagents** for bounded, in-session parallelism where one leader thread can fan out a few independent subtasks and wait for them directly.
- Use **`gjc team`** when you need durable visible tmux workers, shared task state, worker mailbox files, worktrees, explicit lifecycle control, or long-running execution that must survive beyond one local reasoning burst.
- Native subagents can complement team execution, but they do **not** replace the tmux team runtime's stateful coordination contract.

## What This Skill Must Do

## GPT-5.5 Guidance Alignment

Use the shared workflow guidance pattern: outcome-first framing, concise visible updates for multi-step work, local overrides for the active workflow branch, validation proportional to risk, explicit stop rules, and automatic continuation for safe reversible steps. Ask only for material, destructive, credentialed, external-production, or preference-dependent branches.

When user triggers `$team`, the agent must:

1. Invoke GJC runtime directly with `gjc team ...`
2. Avoid replacing the flow with in-process `spawn_agent` fanout
3. Verify startup and surface concrete state/pane evidence
4. If active team mode state is missing, initialize/sync it from canonical team runtime state before proceeding
5. Keep team state alive until the worker is terminal (unless explicit abort)
6. Handle cleanup and stale-pane recovery when needed

If `gjc team` is unavailable, stop with a hard error.

## Invocation Contract

```bash
gjc team [N:agent-type] "<task description>"
```

Examples:

```bash
gjc team 3:executor "analyze feature X and report flaws"
gjc team "debug flaky integration tests"
gjc team "ship end-to-end fix with verification"
```

### Team-first launch contract

`gjc team ...` is now the canonical launch path for coordinated execution.
Team mode should carry visible worker delivery/verification lanes without
requiring a separate linked execution loop up front. GJC team supports current-window multi-worker mode; explicit `N:agent-type` values select worker count and shared role.

- **Canonical launch:** use plain `gjc team ...` / `$team ...` for the coordinated worker.
- **Verification ownership:** keep one lane focused on tests, regression coverage, and evidence before shutdown.
- **Escalation:** use a new explicit follow-up task only when later manual work still needs a persistent single-owner fix/verification loop.
- **Deprecation:** nested team execution commands have been removed. Use plain `gjc team ...` for coordinated execution.

### Team + Ultragoal bridge

Use `$ultragoal` for durable leader-owned goal/ledger tracking and `$team` for parallel visible tmux execution lanes. When Team is launched with an active `.gjc/ultragoal/goals.json`, worker task/status context may include leader-owned Ultragoal context: `.gjc/ultragoal/goals.json`, `.gjc/ultragoal/ledger.jsonl`, the active goal id, GJC goal mode, and the `fresh_leader_get_goal_required` checkpoint policy.

Workers provide task status and verification evidence only. They do not own Ultragoal goal state, create worker ledgers, mutate `.gjc/ultragoal`, auto-launch Team from Ultragoal, or perform hidden GJC goal mutation. The leader uses terminal Team evidence plus a fresh `get_goal` snapshot to run `gjc ultragoal checkpoint --goal-id <id> --status complete --evidence "<team evidence mentioning .gjc/ultragoal and <id>>" --gjc-goal-json <fresh-get_goal-json-or-path>`.

### Worker command override

Important: `N:agent-type` (for example `3:executor`) selects the worker count and role prompt. Plain `gjc team "task"` defaults to 3 executor workers; `gjc team 1:executor "task"` is the explicit single-worker form.

To launch the worker with a specific GJC-compatible command, use `GJC_TEAM_WORKER_COMMAND`:

```bash
GJC_TEAM_WORKER_COMMAND="bun packages/coding-agent/src/cli.ts" gjc team executor "update docs and report"
```

## Preconditions

Before running `$team`, confirm:

1. `tmux` installed (`tmux -V`)
2. Current leader session is inside tmux (`$TMUX` is set)
3. `gjc` command resolves to the intended install/build
4. If running repo-local `node bin/gjc.js ...`, run `npm run build` after `src` changes
5. Check HUD pane count in the leader window and avoid duplicate `hud --watch` panes before split

Suggested preflight:

```bash
tmux list-panes -F '#{pane_id}\t#{pane_start_command}' | rg 'hud --watch' || true
```

If duplicates exist, remove extras before `gjc team` to prevent HUD ending up in worker stack.

## Pre-context Intake Gate

Before launching `gjc team`, require a grounded context snapshot:

1. Derive a task slug from the request.
2. Reuse the latest relevant snapshot in `.gjc/context/{slug}-*.md` when available.
3. If none exists, create `.gjc/context/{slug}-{timestamp}.md` (UTC `YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ`) with:
   - task statement
   - desired outcome
   - known facts/evidence
   - constraints
   - unknowns/open questions
   - likely codebase touchpoints
4. If ambiguity remains high, run `explore` first for brownfield facts, then run `$deep-interview --quick <task>` before team launch.
5. If current correctness depends on official docs, version-aware framework guidance, best practices, or external dependency behavior, auto-delegate `researcher` as an evidence lane before or alongside worker launch instead of relying on repo-local recall alone.

Do not start the worker pane until this gate is satisfied; if forced to proceed quickly, state explicit scope/risk limitations in the launch report.

For simple read-only brownfield lookups during intake, follow active session guidance: when `USE_GJC_EXPLORE_CMD` is enabled, prefer `gjc explore` with narrow, concrete prompts; otherwise use the richer normal explore path and fall back normally if `gjc explore` is unavailable.

## Follow-up Staffing Contract

When `$team` is used as a follow-up mode from ralplan, carry forward the approved plan's explicit **available-agent-types roster** and convert it into concrete staffing guidance before launch:

- keep worker-role choices inside the known roster
- state that GJC team launches the requested worker count and role allocation
- state the suggested reasoning level for each lane when available
- explain why each lane exists (delivery, verification, specialist support)
- include an explicit launch hint (`gjc team "<task>"` / `$team "<task>"`) for the coordinated worker run; mention `$ultragoal` as the default durable follow-up/ledger path; mention a later separate Single-owner execution follow-up only when explicitly requested or genuinely needed as a fallback
- if the ideal role is unavailable, choose the closest role from the roster and say so

## Current Runtime Behavior (As Implemented)

`gjc team` currently performs:

1. Parse args (`N`, `agent-type`, task), default to 3 workers, and cap workers at 20.
2. Non-dry-run: detect the current tmux leader context with `display-message -p "#S:#I #{pane_id}"` before creating state or worktrees.
3. Initialize team state:
   - `.gjc/state/team/<team>/config.json`
   - `.gjc/state/team/<team>/manifest.v2.json`
   - `.gjc/state/team/<team>/tasks/task-1.json`
   - `.gjc/state/team/<team>/mailbox/worker-1.json`
4. Resolve the worker command from `GJC_TEAM_WORKER_COMMAND` or the active `gjc` entrypoint.
5. Split the current tmux window like GJC team: worker 1 is split horizontally to the right of the leader, workers 2..N are vertically stacked in the right column, then `select-layout main-vertical` and `main-pane-width` keep leader-left/worker-right at roughly 50/50.
6. Launch the worker with:
   - `GJC_TEAM_NAME=<team>`
   - `GJC_TEAM_WORKER_ID=worker-1`
   - `GJC_TEAM_STATE_ROOT=<leader-cwd>/.gjc/state/team`
   - optional `GJC_TEAM_WORKTREE_PATH=<path>` when worktree mode is active
7. Store pane/target evidence in config/manifest/snapshot: `tmux_session`, `tmux_session_name`, `tmux_target`, leader pane id, and worker pane id.
8. Return control to the leader; follow-up uses `status`, `resume`, `shutdown`, and `gjc team api`.

Important:

- Leader remains in the existing left pane.
- Worker panes are independent full GJC worker CLI sessions on the right side of a leader-left/worker-right split.
- The worker may run in a dedicated git worktree (`gjc team --worktree[=<name>]`) while sharing the team state root.
- `shutdown` kills only the recorded worker pane after confirming it still belongs to the stored tmux target and is not the leader pane. It never kills the tmux session.

## Required Lifecycle (Operator Contract)

Follow this exact lifecycle when running `$team`:

1. Start team and verify startup evidence (team line, tmux target, worker pane id, state dir).
2. Monitor task progress with runtime/state tools first (`gjc team status <team>`, `gjc team resume <team>`, task files).
3. Wait for terminal task state before shutdown:
   - `pending=0`
   - `in_progress=0`
   - `failed=0` (or explicitly acknowledged failure path)
4. Only then run `gjc team shutdown <team>`.
5. Verify shutdown evidence and preserved state (`phase=complete`, worker status `stopped`).

Do not run `shutdown` while the worker is actively writing updates unless user explicitly requested abort/cancel. Do not treat ad-hoc pane typing as primary control flow when runtime/state evidence is available.

### Active leader monitoring rule

While a team is running, keep checking live team state until terminal completion.

Minimum acceptable loop:

```bash
sleep 30 && gjc team status <team-name>
```

## Operational Commands

```bash
gjc team status <team-name>
gjc team resume <team-name>
gjc team shutdown <team-name>
```

Semantics:

- `status`: reads team snapshot (task counts, worker state, tmux target/pane evidence).
- `resume`: reads the same live team snapshot for reconnect/inspection flows.
- `shutdown`: kills the recorded worker pane when it still belongs to the stored tmux target, removes clean created worktrees, marks worker stopped, and marks phase complete. It preserves `.gjc/state/team/<team>` as evidence.

## Data Plane and Control Plane

### Control Plane

- Current tmux leader window and one or more worker panes.
- `gjc team` lifecycle commands.
- `gjc team api claim-task` and `gjc team api transition-task-status`.

### Data Plane

- `.gjc/state/team/<team>/config.json`
- `.gjc/state/team/<team>/manifest.v2.json`
- `.gjc/state/team/<team>/phase.json`
- `.gjc/state/team/<team>/events.jsonl`
- `.gjc/state/team/<team>/telemetry.jsonl`
- `.gjc/state/team/<team>/tasks/task-1.json`
- `.gjc/state/team/<team>/mailbox/worker-1.json`

## Team Mutation Interop (CLI-first)

Use `gjc team api` for machine-readable task lifecycle operations.

```bash
gjc team api claim-task --input '{"team_name":"my-team","worker_id":"worker-1"}' --json
gjc team api transition-task-status --input '{"team_name":"my-team","task_id":"task-1","to":"completed","claim_token":"<claim-token>"}' --json
```

Canonical worker lifecycle operations:

- `claim-task`
- `transition-task-status`
- `release-task-claim`

GJC-team interop operations are also available for mailbox, worker heartbeat/status, events, monitor snapshots, approvals, and shutdown request/ack flows; run `gjc team api --help` for the full operation list.

Worker protocol:

- Claim pending work with `claim-task`.
- Transition the task to `completed`, `failed`, or `blocked` with `transition-task-status`.
- Record implementation/verification evidence in normal task output and state files; do not assume a separate leader confirmation mailbox or queue exists.

## Environment Knobs

Useful runtime env vars:

- `GJC_TEAM_TMUX_COMMAND`
  - tmux binary/command override (default `tmux`)
- `GJC_TEAM_WORKER_COMMAND`
  - worker command override (default resolves to active GJC entrypoint or `gjc`)
- `GJC_TEAM_STATE_ROOT`
  - team state root override (default `<cwd>/.gjc/state/team`)

## Failure Modes and Diagnosis

Operator note (important for GJC panes):
- Manual Enter injection (`tmux send-keys ... C-m`) can appear to "do nothing" when a worker is actively processing; Enter may be queued by the pane/task flow.
- This is not necessarily a runtime bug. Confirm worker/team state before diagnosing worker failure.
- Avoid repeated blind Enter spam; it can create noisy duplicate submits once the pane becomes idle.

### Common failures

- **Outside tmux:** non-dry-run launch fails before team state or worktrees are created. Start `gjc team` from an attached tmux leader pane.
- **Split failure:** startup records a failed phase if state was already initialized, rolls back created worktrees, and never kills the leader tmux session.
- **Worker API ENOENT:** team state is missing or `GJC_TEAM_STATE_ROOT` points somewhere else. Check `.gjc/state/team/<team>/` before assuming worker failure.
- **Stale pane on shutdown:** shutdown only kills a recorded worker pane when it still belongs to the stored `tmux_target` and is not the leader pane. Stale panes outside that target require manual inspection.

### Safe Manual Intervention (last resort)

Use only after checking `gjc team status <team>` and state evidence:

1. Inspect team files:
   - `.gjc/state/team/<team>/config.json`
   - `.gjc/state/team/<team>/tasks/task-1.json`
   - `.gjc/state/team/<team>/mailbox/worker-1.json`
2. Capture pane tail to confirm current worker state:
   - `tmux capture-pane -t %<worker-pane> -p -S -120`
   - If a larger-tail read or bounded summary would help, prefer explicit opt-in inspection via `gjc sparkshell --tmux-pane %<worker-pane> --tail-lines 400` before improvising extra tmux commands.
3. If the pane is stuck in an interactive state, safely return to idle prompt first:
   - optional interrupt `C-c` or escape flow (CLI-specific) once, then re-check pane capture
4. Send one concise trigger only when runtime/state checks show manual prompt input is needed:
   - `tmux send-keys -t %<worker-pane> "continue current task; report status" C-m`
5. Re-check pane output, task state, worker mailbox, and `gjc team status <team>`.

### Shutdown reports success but stale worker panes remain

Cause:
- The stale pane was not the recorded worker pane, no longer belonged to the stored `tmux_target`, or came from a previous failed run.

Fix:
- Manually inspect panes before cleanup and kill only verified stale worker panes.

## Clean-Slate Recovery

Run from leader pane:

```bash
# 1) Inspect panes
tmux list-panes -F '#{pane_id}	#{pane_current_command}	#{pane_start_command}'

# 2) Kill verified stale worker panes only (examples)
tmux kill-pane -t %450
tmux kill-pane -t %451

# 3) Remove stale team state only after preserving needed evidence (example)
rm -rf .gjc/state/team/<team-name>

# 4) Retry
gjc team executor "fresh retry"
```

Guidelines:

- Do not kill the leader pane.
- Do not kill HUD panes unless intentionally restarting HUD.
- Prefer `gjc team shutdown <team>` for recorded active workers; use manual pane cleanup only for verified stale panes.

## Required Reporting During Execution

When operating this skill, provide concrete progress evidence:

1. Team started line (`Team started: <name>`)
2. tmux target and worker pane id
3. task state from `gjc team status <team>` or `.gjc/state/team/<team>/tasks/task-1.json`
4. shutdown outcome (`phase=complete`, worker status `stopped`) when the run is terminal

Do not claim success without file/pane evidence.
Do not claim clean completion if shutdown occurred with `in_progress>0`.
Use `gjc sparkshell --tmux-pane ...` as an explicit opt-in operator aid for pane inspection and summaries; keep raw `tmux capture-pane` evidence available for manual intervention and proof.

## Programmatic Team Orchestration

Use the `gjc team ...` CLI as the supported team-launch surface. For automation, drive the same CLI flow from scripts or supervising agents rather than relying on a separate runtime integration runner.

### Supported current surfaces

- **`gjc team ...` CLI** — Primary method for interactive or automated team orchestration. Use this when you want direct tmux-pane visibility or a scriptable launch path.
- **Team state files** — Inspect `.gjc/state/team/<team>/` when you need status, task, or mailbox evidence after launch.

### Cleanup distinction

Two cleanup paths exist and must not be confused:

- `team_cleanup` (**state-server**): Deletes team state **files** on disk (`.gjc/state/team/<team>/`). Use after a team run is fully complete.
- tmux/session cleanup: Use the documented `gjc team` shutdown / cleanup flow when you need to stop the worker pane or clean up an interrupted run.

### Automation example

```
1. gjc team executor "fix bugs"
2. gjc team status <team-name>
3. gjc team shutdown <team-name>
4. Clean up the finished team state for <team-name>
```

## Limitations

- Worktree provisioning requires a git repository and can fail on branch/path collisions
- send-keys interactions can be timing-sensitive under load
- stale panes from prior runs can interfere until manually cleaned

## Scenario Examples

**Good:** The user says `continue` after the workflow already has a clear next step. Continue the current branch of work instead of restarting or re-asking the same question.

**Good:** The user changes only the output shape or downstream delivery step (for example `make a PR`). Preserve earlier non-conflicting workflow constraints and apply the update locally.

**Bad:** The user says `continue`, and the workflow restarts discovery or stops before the missing verification/evidence is gathered.
