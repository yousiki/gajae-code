/**
 * Ralplan approval + ultragoal execution gate mapping (#317).
 *
 * Maps the two human-gated lifecycle decisions onto `workflow_gate` events:
 *  - ralplan `pending approval` -> `workflow_gate` { kind: "approval" } whose
 *    answer is one of approve / request-changes / reject (+ optional comments);
 *  - ultragoal execution sign-off -> `workflow_gate` { kind: "execution" } whose
 *    answer is approve / decline (+ optional reason).
 *
 * Gates remain mandatory; the external agent substitutes for the human at the
 * answer boundary only. Declining / requesting changes is honored and is NEVER
 * silently treated as approval.
 *
 * This is the pure mapping primitive; routing ralplan/ultragoal through it when
 * an unattended controller + gate broker are attached is wired with the transport
 * in #321 and exercised end-to-end by #323.
