/**
 * Deterministic recovery classifier (pure).
 *
 * Maps a bounded {@link Observation} + remaining retry budget to exactly one
 * {@link RecoveryDecision}. Encodes the plan's hard data-loss invariants:
 *   - dirty deltas are NEVER `restart-clean`; they map to `restart-preserve-delta`.
 *   - unknown deltas are NEVER destructive; they map to `human-check`.
 *   - a deleted/mismatched worktree maps to `human-check` (never recreate over unknown data).
 * `send-enter` is intentionally never emitted: it is unsupported for the gajae-code
 * transport adapter in v1 (no blind key injection).
