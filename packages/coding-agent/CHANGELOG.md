# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Mapped the retired `codex-standard` model profile name to `codex-medium` during profile activation, **as a fallback only** so a user-defined profile literally named `codex-standard` is never shadowed, letting stale `modelProfile.default: codex-standard` configs reach activation instead of blocking startup after the rebuilt profile catalog.
- Fixed interactive goal-mode auto-continuation looping `Error: Agent is already processing…` (`AgentBusyError`) while the session is busy. A wedged/orphaned subagent turn — or an in-progress compaction — can leave the session non-idle while the interactive loop is back at `getUserInput()`; the 800 ms continuation timer then fired `prompt()`, threw `AgentBusyError`, surfaced it via `showError`, and re-armed — spamming the error roughly every 800 ms. The continuation now skips and re-arms while `isStreaming`/`isCompacting`, firing only once the session returns to idle.
- Fixed the built-in `minimax-eco`/`minimax-medium`/`minimax-pro` model profiles 400ing on activation because every role pinned the non-existent `minimax-code/minimax-v3`. All three profiles now pin `minimax-code/minimax-m3`, the canonical `minimax-code` default already present in the bundled models catalog (#656).
- Fixed the native Stop hook letting a deep-interview run terminalize through the ordinary stop path without crystallizing its distilled interview state. A deep-interview mode-state that would release the Stop block (e.g. `active:true` with a `complete`/`completed`/`inactive` phase) is now held until it has actually persisted a final spec — a `spec_path` that still resolves to a real `.gjc/specs/` artifact — and the public-safe diagnostic points the agent at `gjc deep-interview --write --stage final` (optionally `--handoff ralplan`). The guard is scoped to deep-interview only: explicit abort/cancel phases (`failed`/`cancelled`/`canceled`) and the `active:false` demotion/clear outcome remain legitimate terminals, and no other workflow's stop behavior changes (#674).

### Added

- Added three bundled dark TUI migration themes — `claude-code`, `codex`, and `opencode` — whose palettes mirror the Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI, and opencode TUIs for easy eye-migration. They join the crustacean defaults (`red-claw` dark, `blue-crab` light) as selectable built-ins via Settings or `/theme`; defaults are unchanged and the new themes keep GJC's default symbol identity. A built-in inventory test now validates every bundled theme against the required `THEME_COLOR_KEYS` token set, name/key equality, var resolution, dark classification, and brand-vs-semantic token separation.
- Documented and regression-guarded the `gjc --tmux` scroll/mouse profile so WSL/Linux launches are not left guessing about mouse-wheel scrolling. The GJC-managed tmux session already applies `mouse on` (plus `set-clipboard on` and a readable copy-mode `mode-style`) scoped to the GJC session only, on macOS/Linux/WSL alike (only native `win32` skips the tmux launch); a new launch-path test asserts a WSL/Linux `--tmux` launch issues session-scoped `set-option ... mouse on` (never global `set -g`) and that `GJC_MOUSE=off` opts out without dropping the ownership tags. `docs/environment-variables.md` now documents the `--tmux` startup env vars (`GJC_LAUNCH_POLICY`, `GJC_TMUX_SESSION`, `GJC_TMUX_COMMAND`, `GJC_TMUX_PROFILE`, `GJC_MOUSE`) and the WSL/Windows Terminal scroll behavior (tmux copy-mode wheel scroll vs. native scrollback, copy-mode keyboard fallback, and that GJC never modifies tmux sessions you started yourself), and `gjc --help` surfaces `GJC_TMUX_PROFILE`/`GJC_MOUSE` (#650).

## [0.5.1] - 2026-06-14

### Added

- `gjc --mode rpc` registers each live session in a cross-process registry (`<agent-dir>/rpc-sessions/<id>.json`) on start and removes it on shutdown, so other processes can enumerate running RPC sessions. The Python `gjc_rpc` client exposes `list_sessions()` / `RpcClient.list_sessions()` returning typed `SessionHandle`s and reaps records whose owning process is gone (issue 10; foundation for reattach/issue 09).
- `gjc --mode rpc --listen <socket-path>` runs a persistent Unix-domain-socket RPC server: the `AgentSession` outlives client disconnects (no stdin-EOF teardown) and a client can disconnect and reconnect to the same live session over the socket. The session is registered with `transport: "socket"` and the socket path as its `endpoint`, so it is discoverable/attachable via the registry. The stdio path is unchanged (frame output routes through a swappable sink shared by both transports) (issue 09).

### Fixed

- Subagent/job status panels now freeze a job's elapsed timer the moment it stops running (`completed`/`failed`/`cancelled`/`paused`) instead of counting up against `Date.now()` forever. `AsyncJob` records an `endTime` on the first terminal/pause transition and a shared `jobElapsedMs` helper backs the `subagent` panel, the `job` tool, `/jobs`, and the command-controller job line, so a finished subagent stops at its real duration while siblings keep ticking.
- RPC control-plane hardening (from dogfooding `gjc --mode rpc`): `dispatchRpcCommand` now wraps the command switch so failures return a correlated response carrying the request `id` and the real command name, instead of dropping the id and mislabeling handler exceptions as `parse`; `set_thinking_level`/`set_steering_mode`/`set_follow_up_mode`/`set_interrupt_mode` validate their inputs and reject out-of-contract values instead of silently corrupting session state; `negotiate_unattended` rejects unknown scopes/action classes with `invalid_unattended_declaration` and merges the mandatory `prompt` scope plus its `command.prompt` action floor into the accepted grant (so prompt/`workflow_gate_response` are never locked out); and read-only/control RPC commands no longer consume the unattended `max_tool_calls` budget while wall-time enforcement is preserved. `docs/rpc.md`'s first `workflow_gate` example now matches the canonical `RpcWorkflowGate` shape.
- RPC mode no longer head-of-line-blocks control/cancellation commands behind a long-running command: the stdin loop now dispatches ordered commands through a serial chain (so causal order is preserved — e.g. `get_state` after `bash` still observes the bash result) without blocking the reader, and routes `abort`/`abort_bash`/`abort_retry` on an immediate fast lane so they reach in-flight work. `abort_bash` can now cancel a running `bash`, and a slow `compact`/`handoff`/`login` no longer freezes the whole control plane. Shutdown drains in-flight commands (bounded) so their responses are still emitted on stdin EOF.
- Counted active prompts and agent-initiated custom messages in pre-prompt context maintenance so background task notifications trigger compaction before they can overflow the next model request.
- Bounded monitor task-notification payloads to a compact tail window while preserving full background job output for job inspection.

### Changed

- Expanded coordinator MCP coordination status into a canonical polling snapshot for sessions, session states, turns, questions, reports, and bounded event summaries, and documented that Hermes/coordinator consumption is polling/await rather than push subscription.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed

- Fixed forced `tool_choice` 400s ("tool_choice forces tool use is not compatible with this model") looping after `ast_edit` previews: named queue directives (resolve protocol, eager `todo_write` enforcement, subagent `yield` reminders) now enqueue only when the model supports exact named forcing; otherwise they degrade silently to the existing steer reminder without a forced `tool_choice`, and a runtime-discovered incapability drops the in-flight directive instead of requeueing it.
- `models.yml` compat blocks now accept the `toolChoiceSupport` enum (`none`/`auto`/`required`/`named`) alongside the legacy `supportsToolChoice`/`supportsForcedToolChoice` booleans, mirrored in the generated JSON schema.
### Added

- Made `/model` open to a preset-first landing view: provider-grouped presets with live auth checkmarks, highlight-to-expand tiers, a full clamped role→model preview before applying, and a session/default apply scope choice; typing still jumps straight to model search, "Browse all models" opens the classic tabbed selector, and temporary-only quick-switch bypasses the landing entirely.
- Rebuilt the builtin model profile catalog as 25 profiles: `codex-{eco,medium,pro}` on `gpt-5.5` effort spreads, a single `opencodego` preset, `claude-opus`, `{glm,kimi-coding-plan,mimo,grok,cursor,minimax}-{eco,medium,pro}` trios with thinking levels clamped to provider support, and `opus-codex`/`codex-opencodego` combos. Legacy profile names (including the `*-standard` family and retired Fable presets) were removed clean-break and now fail with the available-profile listing.
- Added a post-`/login` smart preset recommendation: when login succeeds and no profile is active, prompts "Apply <preset> now?" (session-only on confirm); when a profile is active, prints a one-line hint instead. The active profile is tracked in-memory on the session with rollback-safe activation.
- Bundled `kimi-code/kimi-k2.7-code` and `minimax-code/minimax-v3` model entries; MiniMax presets use the canonical `minimax-code` provider id throughout.
- Added a harness receipt JSONL spool exporter for gajae receipt-runtime interop: configured `gjc harness --receipt-spool-dir <dir>` / `GJC_RECEIPT_SPOOL_DIR` now appends persisted native `ReceiptEnvelope` records as `{cursor,envelope}` lines to `spool.jsonl`, with restart-safe 12-digit cursors and installed-package smoke coverage (#545).
- Added Gajae Trinity compatibility golden fixtures and tests that pin ReceiptEnvelope hash basis, validator compatibility, and replayable RPC exchange shape for downstream receipt-runtime interop.
- Optimization Suite v3 Lane 1 (RSS): large resident text in persisted sessions is now backed by an ephemeral session-scoped disk cache (`EphemeralBlobStore`) instead of being pinned in JS heap for the whole session lifetime; canonical JSONL persistence, reload, and export semantics are byte-identical (resident refs never persist). Missing resident text cache blobs now surface a typed `ResidentBlobMissingError` instead of silently leaking `blob:sha256:` refs into provider payloads, UI, or exports. `getEntries()`/`buildSessionContext()` are served from revision-keyed WeakRef caches below the public ownership boundary (callers still receive caller-owned copies). Fixture retained heap −82%, RSS −55%, warm `getEntries()` p95 −80% on 10k-entry sessions; one-shot `exportFromFile()` now closes its session manager.
- Added process-isolated deterministic TUI render-golden capture and fixtures for interactive editor overlays, rich-text resizing, multiplexer viewport repaint, sixel image line preservation, Termux height diffs, and transcript shrink/clear regressions.

### Removed

- Removed the hardcoded OpenAI Codex role-preset action from the model selector; builtin model profiles are now the only preset concept.
- Removed retired Fable model profiles (`claude-fable`, `fable-codex`) after `claude-fable-5` was removed upstream.

### Changed

- Optimization Suite v3 Lane 3 (serialization): session-switch message comparison now uses per-message cached source strings + xxHash64 as an accelerator (source-string compare remains the authority; collision fallback tested) — unchanged-session compares −95% median. The secret obfuscator precomputes a longest-first combined regex (single-pass replace, −70% median/−77% p95 on 100 secrets × 1MiB) with a conservative sequential fallback whenever secrets overlap each other or any replacement/placeholder contains a secret — output bytes are identical in all cases. Intra-line diff rendering gains byte-identical fast paths for identical lines and whitespace-token-aligned prefix/suffix spans (identical −67%, single-token −60%; long lines skip the scan). Mental-model LCS keeps legacy dense-DP tie-break semantics (a Hunt-Szymanski variant was rejected for changing rendered bytes). Provider-visible fork-context seeds use JSON-semantic cloning instead of structuredClone.
- Tightened tool-block rendering to remove vertical padding and rely on Spacer-only separation, reducing transcript noise while preserving stable render-golden output.
- Improved the Bun runtime version guard diagnostic: when the Bun running `gjc` is older than the required version, the error now names the exact detected Bun runtime path and prints a platform-specific upgrade and PATH fix (Windows gets the `irm bun.sh/install.ps1|iex` reinstall plus a `%USERPROFILE%\.bun\bin` PATH hint) instead of a bare `bun upgrade` (#525).
- Aligned the `codex-standard` and `codex-pro` model profiles on the `openai-codex/gpt-5.5` baseline so they no longer default to stale mixed model generations (`gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.2-codex`, `gpt-5.1-codex-max`, `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`); the profiles now differentiate purely by per-role reasoning effort (#532).
- Reduced the default RPC `get_state` payload by omitting static `dumpTools` and `systemPrompt` fields unless requested via `include: ["tools", "systemPrompt"]` (#539).
- Updated `/model` documentation and generated docs index for the rebuilt preset catalog and preset-first selector.

### Fixed

- Tightened the Windows/psmux tmux provider boundary: `gjc team` now honors `GJC_TMUX_COMMAND` (not just `GJC_TEAM_TMUX_COMMAND`) so the team leader resolves the same multiplexer as `gjc session`/`gjc --tmux`; and when a multiplexer lists a session that lacks GJC's `@gjc-profile` ownership tag, `gjc session status` now returns `gjc_tmux_session_untagged` with a `detail` hint and `gjc team` reports the same cause, instead of a bare `gjc_tmux_session_not_found` / `unmanaged_tmux_session`. Documented that alternative multiplexers such as psmux on Windows are not fully supported because they do not round-trip tmux user options (#531).
- Hardened RPC stdio lifecycle behavior: `gjc --mode rpc` now reports malformed JSONL frames as parse-error responses without killing the session, flushes durable session state before exiting on EOF/shutdown, and has red-team coverage for attached persistence, reload, malformed-frame recovery, and concurrent child-session isolation.
- Hardened the harness RPC submit/router contract so `submit` is no longer advertised or accepted during finalizing/non-idle lifecycle windows, non-idle RPC state reports `submitted:false` with a retryable gate, and degraded owner endpoints fall back to `owner-not-live` without false acceptance (#544).
- Ran estimated context maintenance before sending a new prompt, including tool-output pruning and threshold compaction, so large tool results appended after the last assistant turn cannot push the next model request over the context window.
- `gjc team` now self-heals a missing `@gjc-profile` ownership tag when the current leader pane was genuinely launched by `gjc --tmux` (detected via `GJC_TMUX_LAUNCHED=1`): the session is re-tagged with `set-option` and startup proceeds, instead of hard-failing with `unmanaged_tmux_session` after a mid-startup attach failure or registry race stripped the tag. Sessions without the GJC launch marker are still rejected unchanged, so foreign tmux sessions cannot be hijacked.
- Subagent task receipts and live render output now warn when requested role-agent models are substituted by auth fallback or provider-reported assistant model mismatch, including session model-change annotations for server-side substitutions (#559).
- Converted Cursor wire shell timeouts from millisecond values to bash-tool seconds so delegated Cursor-native shell calls honor the expected timeout units.
- Fixed pi-shell bash fixups on multibyte UTF-8 commands by converting parser source indexes to byte offsets before stripping `head`/`tail` pipelines.

## [0.4.5] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- Added a dim `(ctrl+s to observe sessions)` discoverability hint under the `subagent` await panel header while any awaited subagent is still running, pointing to the full session observer overlay; the hint shows in both collapsed and expanded states and disappears once no subagent is running.
- Added a `phase-rollup` receipt family (receipt-of-receipts) to the harness control plane: a hash-sealed rollup that supersedes N child task receipts at a lifecycle boundary, preserving per-child `{id, status, outputUri, outputSha256, receiptSha256, tokens, costTotal, clonedTokens, lowRoi}` pointers plus aggregate ROI totals, with a pure deterministic builder (`buildPhaseRollupReceipt`) and fail-closed semantic validation.
- Added a pure receipt-ingestion fast path (`ingestReceipts`): fail-closed batch validation + lifecycle transition computation via the existing state machine, plus a deterministic model-facing digest hard-capped at 280 chars — groundwork for LLM-free receipt routing.
- Added advisory spawn-ROI reconciliation (`reconcileSpawnRoi`) and deterministic fork-context mode advice (`adviseForkContextMode`) surfaced in task receipts without changing task success semantics.
- Added the Grok Build provider contract design document.

### Changed

- Reduced compiled CLI startup and native bundle pressure with default-small grammar loading, tokenizer tiering, and compiled fast-help paths.
- Preserved dev/main release metadata and changelog consistency for the 0.4.5 lockstep release.

- Added native `gjc ultragoal steer --kind` support for documented steering mutations beyond `add_subgoal`, including split, reorder, wording revision, ledger annotation, and blocked-goal supersession contracts with structured audit expectations.
### Fixed

- Kept the unified `goal` tool registered and active by default whenever `goal.enabled` is true, including explicit tool subsets and `gjc ultragoal create-goals` arming flows.
- Restored no-argument `gjc` interactive startup instead of launching help.
- Rendered and executed Cursor-native tool calls, including detached/native handler paths and empty-pattern composer grep guards.
- Tool-output pruning no longer rewrites already-sent provider-facing history mid prompt-cache epoch and now persists pruned message updates back into canonical session storage.
- Preserved provider abort root causes in the final TUI abort label, kept replay rendering idempotent, and added a `PI_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` remediation hint when stream idle watchdogs fire.
- Hardened harness owner recovery/finalize paths and submit-prompt-file handling.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- Made coordinator turns event-backed, adding an MCP coordinator server and the `gjc coordinator` / `gjc mcp-serve` commands backed by durable turn/session state (#479).
- Surfaced awaited sub-agent live streaming status in the await panel (#475).

### Changed

- Refreshed the README brand images (#477).

### Fixed

- Persisted ralplan role-agent artifacts via the CLI, returning receipt-only output to the caller (#474).
- Collected the `ask` tool "Other" custom input inline below the option list (#476).

## [0.4.3] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- Added a `busyPromptMode` setting (`steer` | `queue`, default `steer`) so a prompt submitted while the agent is busy can either steer the active turn or be queued to run after it completes, keeping steering and queued-next-turn semantics distinct. Ctrl+Enter still always queues as a follow-up (#434).
### Fixed

- Fixed a persistent `monitor` notification flood where a cancelled or evicted monitor kept delivering queued `task-notification` follow-ups (surviving process death, log deletion, and `job cancel` returning not-found). Monitors now purge their queued notifications on cancel/terminal/eviction, retain a short tombstone so post-eviction `job cancel` still purges, coalesce rapid duplicate output to the latest state, and close a cancel/trailing-flush race.
- Fixed `ultragoal` execution leaking across concurrent independent GJC sessions. The runtime `goal-mode-request.json` is now stamped with the producing session's `GJC_SESSION_ID`, and the consumer only activates a request that belongs to the current session (another session's request is left intact instead of being consumed/deleted). Legacy unscoped requests remain consumable for single-session compatibility ([#457](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code/issues/457)).

## [0.4.2] - 2026-06-09

### Changed

- Added conservative `timeout-minutes` values to all CI workflow jobs to prevent indefinite hangs.
- Made coordinator MCP turn waiting state-backed by durable turn/session files, with runtime session sidecar updates for running/completed/error states and Meeseeks guidance that avoids fixed sleep/capture-pane loops.

### Fixed

- Failed stale coordinator turns quickly when their recorded tmux session is gone, clearing active-turn state instead of burning await timeouts.
- Improved the grep limit-reached message to show the current limit value and suggest using `--limit` for more results.
- Passed the active model's `maxTokens` (reserved completion budget) into the auto-compaction threshold and context-usage reserve so prompt packing reserves output for large-window models, keeping the safe input budget below the total context window (e.g. ~272K for a 400K/128K model) instead of filling the whole window ([#442](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code/issues/442)).
- Fixed a `gjc harness` recovery deadlock where a session created by `start` without `--detach` (persisted as `started` with no owner lease/endpoint) could never get a live owner: `recover` refused to spawn one because no prior endpoint existed, while `start` reported `session-already-exists`. `recover` now bootstraps a fresh owner for a never-started session (no lease, no endpoint, no owner-run evidence) without writing a misleading `vanish` receipt, reported via `bootstrappedOwner: true`. Bootstrap is independent of the vanish classifier's `ownerRequired` verdict (nothing has vanished), so a session started in a non-git workspace (git delta `unknown`) is recovered too, while a deleted worktree is still refused (#421).

## [0.4.1] - 2026-06-07

### Changed

- Hardened the default system prompt with a `<skill-discipline>` block (never ignore skill text, keep read-only/interview skills from mutating, recommend and invoke the matching `/skill` on approval) and tightened `<communication>` to ban permission-begging/deferral phrasing and never announce remaining work instead of doing it (#392).
- Cleaned up the bundled GJC workflow skill docs and defaulted execution handoff to ultragoal while prioritizing ralplan refinement (#395, #396).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added

- Added an agent-driven RPC workflow lifecycle control plane and a `workflow_gate` contract: `negotiate_unattended`, `workflow_gate`, and `workflow_gate_response` frames are validated by an answer-schema validator, persisted through a durable gate broker, and wired into live session dispatch (#314).
- Added a binding-only `gjc-plugins` sub-skill plugin framework that loads, validates, and activates declarative plugin packs without granting implicit arbitrary execution surface (#347).
- Added generated JSON Schemas for the config and models files (`schemas/config.schema.json`, `schemas/models.schema.json`) with a `check:schemas` drift gate (#377).
- Added `cacheRetention` support in the models config (#381).
- Added an Opus max reasoning preset (#372).

### Changed

- Improved slash command and `skill:*` suggestion ranking so `/team` surfaces the matching skill before weaker fallback candidates.

### Removed

- Removed the optional `@gajae-code/swarm-extension` package and its `gjc-swarm` CLI. The YAML/DAG swarm orchestration extension was a standalone optional feature not imported by any other package; it is no longer built or published.

### Fixed

- Routed unattended deep-interview ask-tool questions through `workflow_gate { kind: "question" }` events, including Round 0 topology and challenge-mode metadata, free-text option/schema shape, headless RPC answers, and synchronous response race handling (#316).
- Preserved harness owner-vanish evidence after prompt acceptance: no-owner `recover` now either restores a detached owner when a prior endpoint exists or returns a public-safe concrete owner-exit reason plus a vanish receipt, and no-owner `observe`/`events` expose the preserved owner-exit summary.
- Fixed LSP and MCP server lifecycle cleanup so clients/servers and their child processes are torn down on abort/exit instead of leaking (#389).
- Preserved session retention across resident session rewrites.
- Fixed harness session lookup testability without changing runtime owner-routing behavior.
- Prevented release catalog file specs from recursing during catalog resolution (#351).
- Reconciled the ultragoal skill mode-state and HUD with the plan/ledger so status reflects real goal progress (#342/#346).

## [0.3.2] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- Added model profiles with a `--mpreset <profile>` CLI flag and a `/model` selector "Profiles" section that activate a named profile's default model plus per-agent-role model overrides in one step, validating required-provider credentials before applying and surfacing a custom provider onboarding wizard for missing API-compatible providers.
- Integrated `ai-slop-cleaner` as an internal Ultragoal sub-skill fragment that runs as the mandatory completion-gate cleanup sweep over a story's changed files, reporting blocking and advisory findings without editing code or mutating `.gjc/` state.
### Changed

- Edit tool diff generation (`generateDiffString`) now uses the native `diffLines` from `@gajae-code/natives` (a byte-identical Rust port of jsdiff) instead of the pure-JS implementation, removing the multi-second Myers blowup on large-file edits (~16x faster on ~1MB files) with identical diff output.

### Fixed

- Reconciled native Ultragoal commands with workflow mode-state and the HUD: `gjc ultragoal create-goals`, `complete-goals`, `checkpoint`, steering, review-blocker recording, and status now sync `.gjc/state/ultragoal-state.json` plus `skill-active-state.json` from the durable `.gjc/ultragoal` plan/ledger, clearing stale active HUD chips after all goals complete.
- Forwarded the parent session id when task subagents validate configured role-agent model overrides, preventing session-scoped OAuth providers from being misread as unauthenticated and falling back to the parent chat model.
- Removed unintended public memory-tool guidance and registration: Hindsight retain/recall/reflect helpers are now compatibility-only, local memory prompt injection no longer advertises `memory://` reads, and regression tests guard the public tool surface.
- Fixed `read` hashline anchors drifting on truncated reads so the `line+hash` anchors consumed by `edit`/`apply_patch` stay correct when a file is read past the truncation boundary.
- Reconciled the ultragoal skill mode-state (`current_phase`/`active`) and HUD chip with the `.gjc/ultragoal` plan/ledger on every `gjc ultragoal` command (`create-goals`/`complete-goals`/`checkpoint`/`steer`/`record-review-blockers`/`status`), so `gjc state ultragoal read`, the skill-tool chain guard, and the HUD no longer sit at a stale `active:true`/`goal-planning` after a run completes (#342). A new `reconcileWorkflowSkillState` performs a session-scoped (`GJC_SESSION_ID`) derived write that bypasses only transition-edge validation while preserving schema/unknown-phase validation, version/checksum stamping, and audit provenance (`owner: gjc-runtime`, `verb: reconcile`); reconciliation is best-effort and surfaces failures via stderr and a `reconcile_failed` ledger event without changing command status/stdout. Removed the duplicate sessionless active-state sync from the `gjc ultragoal` command wrapper.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-05
### Added

- Added opt-in crash diagnostics for subprocess failures, with a shared crash taxonomy/report writer, bash/Python/LSP/DAP crash notices, and a native Rust panic-report hook gated by `GJC_NATIVE_CRASH_DIAGNOSTICS` / `GJC_CRASH_DIAGNOSTICS`.
- Started the GJC backend bridge foundation with a shared agent-wire protocol module, event envelopes, RPC command scope matrix, UI request broker, typed unsupported UI results, a guarded `--mode bridge` handshake surface, and RPC mode dispatch refactored onto the shared command dispatcher.
- Documented the experimental `--mode bridge` protocol in `docs/bridge.md` and the `GJC_BRIDGE_*` environment variables in `docs/environment-variables.md` (TLS-mandatory startup, bearer auth, coarse command scopes with a `prompt` floor, single live `AgentSession` per process, bounded event-stream replay with `reset`, and the semantic-not-pixel UI capability matrix), and added bridge event-stream/idempotency regression tests plus a docs-conformance check that pins the docs against the protocol version, scope/command catalog, negotiated capabilities/frame types, and unsupported UI surfaces. The bridge protocol/SDK are experimental (`BRIDGE_PROTOCOL_VERSION` 1) and may change in additive, version-negotiated ways.

### Fixed

- Made opt-in crash diagnostics create/chmod report directories to `0700` and report files to `0600` so captured command, cwd, and stderr previews are private even under a permissive umask.
- Scoped `agent://` and `artifact://` resolution to the caller's artifacts directory plus explicitly authorized parent/child tree directories, removed registry-wide live-session lookup/enumeration, and made missing agent-output metadata sidecars fail closed.
- Fail-closed experimental bridge session endpoints by default for 0.3.1: events, commands, controller ownership, UI responses, host tool results, and host URI results are disabled unless an internal endpoint matrix explicitly enables them; only health/help and the authenticated handshake remain available, with the handshake advertising no enabled session surface by default.
- Render terminal-pasted clipboard image temp paths as compact `[image N]` prompt placeholders while attaching the image payload, instead of inserting raw `/var/folders/.../clipboard-*.png` path text.
- Preserved `gjc harness` `owner-vanished:*` blockers when a replacement owner becomes live so unrecovered prior-owner evidence remains visible until explicit recovery or terminal completion evidence; only safe startup liveness false-negatives such as `detached-owner-not-live` are auto-cleared.
- Fixed the interactive agent unexpectedly stopping after automatic context maintenance instead of resuming the in-flight task. Post-compaction continuation now schedules exactly one source per completion (overflow retry → queued messages → synthetic auto-continue prompt), the threshold/handoff auto-continue prompt skips a redundant pre-send compaction check, overflow retry strips only the context-overflow failed turn (never normal/aborted/silent-abort tails), and non-resumable or superseded continuations log a structured reason instead of stranding the session.
- Fixed the native Stop skill-state hook letting active GJC workflow skills stop prematurely. The Stop hook no longer treats a missing/unreadable mode-state file as terminal for handoff workflows, and handoff skills (`deep-interview`, `ralplan`) now keep blocking Stop even in the `handoff` phase until they are demoted (`active:false`) or cleared, so they always end by offering the next handoff step via the ask tool. Non-handoff skills (`team`, `ultragoal`) retain the fail-open safety valve when their mode-state file is corrupt or invalid.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- Added runtime-enforced Ultragoal executor QA/red-team evidence matrices for completion checkpoints, with plan-first contract coverage, user-surface evidence, adversarial cases, artifact references, scoped Executor red-team guidance, and focused rejection tests for shallow or contradictory QA evidence.
### Fixed

- Made `gjc harness observe` preserve completed RPC owner evidence after the owner exits, including a `completedOwnerExited` diagnostic and durable terminal-result cursor.
- Clarified that `gjc team` requires an existing tmux-backed leader session from `gjc --tmux`, with actionable help, docs, and failure text.
- Kept deep-interview ask options visible for long prompts by adding an opt-in scrollable selector title panel with selector-local `PageUp`/`PageDown` prompt scrolling, while leaving normal ask dialogs and global keybinding configuration unchanged.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- Added Claude Code parity `monitor` plus `CronCreate`, `CronList`, and `CronDelete` tools with frozen upstream schema fixtures, inline scheduling, background output monitoring, and ACP permission coverage.

### Changed

- Pruned bundled built-in themes to `red-claw` and `blue-crab`, with `blue-crab` now the default light-appearance theme.
- Clarified ralplan role-agent handoff guidance so Planner/Architect/Critic return compact artifact receipts after `gjc ralplan --write --json` instead of duplicating full persisted verdict markdown into the parent context.
- Made `web_search` permissionless by default with a keyless DuckDuckGo fallback, active-model-gated native provider selection, and explicit-only legacy provider selection so custom providers no longer auto-hit stray OpenAI/Codex OAuth credentials.

### Fixed

- Fixed the skill HUD rail showing already-handed-off planning workflows so it renders only the currently-active stage. Handoffs now supersede every same-session-scope row of the caller and callee skills (not just the exact `skill::session_id` key), the visible-state read collapses duplicate same-skill rows to the most-recent one (so a handoff demotion drops a stale `active:true` row and on-disk state self-heals), and the HUD renderer collapses the `deep-interview → ralplan → ultragoal` pipeline to its most-recent stage. Activating a later stage (e.g. `gjc ultragoal` after ralplan) now supersedes the earlier one even when the activation path does not run the `handoff` verb, while `team` still coexists with ultragoal.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- Added the bundled `blue-crab` dark theme and a TUI-only `/theme` selector that persists the selected appearance slot while keeping `red-claw` as the default dark theme.
- Added `retry.requestMaxRetries` and `retry.streamMaxRetries` settings plus docs for codex-cli-style provider retry budgets ([#157](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code/pull/157)).

### Fixed

- Forwarded a caller-provided `User-Agent` on non-Anthropic proxy base URLs so the anthropic-messages provider no longer strips it, fixing HTTP 403 "request was blocked" rejections from WAF-fronted proxy gateways.
- Restored Settings theme live preview without persisting browse state so confirm/cancel governs the rendered theme and in-flight previews cannot overwrite an explicit choice ([#166](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code/pull/166)).
- Preserved the deep-interview session language so interviews continue in the language they started in ([#168](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code/pull/168)).
- Purged the inherited OMP/pi-mono history from the embedded coding-agent CHANGELOG so post-update notifications and `/changelog` only surface gajae-code releases ([#161](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code/pull/161)).
- Wired `goal` tool `drop`/`complete` semantics so completing or dropping a goal restores the pre-goal toolset in the same session, with refreshed ultragoal docs ([#152](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code/pull/152)).
- Added local-memory empty-payload guidance so the agent does not claim facts were saved or remembered when local memory has no confirmed payload/readback ([#165](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code/pull/165)).
- Fixed `gjc update` binary fallback downloads to use the current owner release repository and report actionable manual update commands for unsupported fallback targets ([#164](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code/pull/164)).

## [0.2.3] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- Added `/provider add --preset minimax|minimax-cn|glm` and matching `gjc setup provider --preset ...` shortcuts for OpenAI-compatible MiniMax and GLM/zAI custom-provider onboarding.
- Added a built-in `skill` tool so the agent can chain into another loaded skill on its next turn. Mirrors `/skill:<name>` typing and subagent `autoloadSkills` by dispatching the chained skill's SKILL.md as a user-attribution custom message; controlled by the new `skill.enabled` setting (default true).
- Added explicit fork-context task subagents with sanitized bounded parent-history seeds, global `task.forkContext.enabled`, per-agent `forkContext: allowed`, per-task `inheritContext: true`, audit-visible seed metadata, and fresh provider transport state by default.
- Defaulted the bundled `executor` and `architect` agents to `forkContext: allowed` so callers can opt them into a sanitized parent-context seed via `task({ inheritContext: true })`; per-task selection remains explicit (default false).
- Added a `/context` slash command that surfaces the active session's token usage breakdown via `buildSessionContext` without forking prompt assembly, so users can see active context before sessions overflow ([#150](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code/pull/150)).
- Added multi-line focused-option rendering to the `ask` tool's `HookSelectorComponent` via an opt-in `wrapFocused` flag so long option labels stay readable in plan-mode and other shared consumers ([#148](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code/pull/148)).
- Added a sanctioned native deep-interview spec persistence bridge so deep-interview can save final specs under `.gjc/specs/` before deliberate ralplan chaining without caller-side `.gjc` writes ([#134](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code/pull/134)).
- Added the skill chaining lifecycle's `handoff` state verb with same-turn dispatch and atomic HUD-truth synchronization across callee mode-state, caller mode-state, session active-state, and root active-state ([#132](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code/pull/132)).

### Changed

- Clarified the README to position team as optional and ultragoal as implementation-through-evidence, so docs readers see workflow handoffs without spelunking into skill sources ([#145](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code/pull/145)).
- Migrated CI to the gajae self-hosted Linux runner with fork-PR guards, idempotent `fd` symlink setup, and Node 24 pinning for self-hosted jobs ([#124](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code/pull/124)).

### Fixed

- Enforced the deep-interview phase boundary so active interviews block mutation tools until a handoff/spec is produced.
- Allowed read-only `architect`, `planner`, and `critic` role agents to persist ralplan/state workflow receipts through a restricted `bash` allowlist while blocking general shell and product-file mutations.
- Made settings theme browsing confirm-only so arrowing through themes no longer changes the rendered theme before the displayed/persisted theme name changes.
- Made startup CHANGELOG display deterministic by embedding `packages/coding-agent/CHANGELOG.md` into the binary so post-update launches show the shipped history regardless of cwd or `GJC_PACKAGE_DIR`/`PI_PACKAGE_DIR` overrides.
- Registered `gjc update` as a public root subcommand so it invokes the bundled updater instead of routing into the interactive launcher.
- Fixed local memory backend persistence so manual enqueue/rebuild starts maintenance immediately and prompt injection reads the active session's memory root.
- Aligned release-bump CI tests with the highest bundled upstream Claude family and stopped cancelling TTSR retries when an aborted partial was not persisted, so dev PRs no longer regress on v0.2.2-style release assumptions ([#142](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code/pull/142)).
- Added a runtime guard in the built-in `skill` tool that rejects re-entry into the currently active skill via a typed active-skill bridge from agent sessions into tool sessions, preventing recursive skill handoffs that prompt-only guidance could not stop ([#129](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code/pull/129)).

## [0.2.2] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- Added `gjc session` for listing, inspecting, removing, and attaching GJC-managed tmux sessions ([#105](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code/pull/105)).
- Added a managed tmux session surface so `gjc --tmux` and `gjc team` reuse a scoped GJC session instead of mutating the global tmux environment.
- Added a detached contribution prep workflow surface ([#122](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code/pull/122)).
- Added stricter `models.yml` validation and docs for OpenAI-compatible proxy providers, bridge-command requirements, and team dry-run state behavior ([#121](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code/pull/121)).
- Added first-class Azure OpenAI and Amazon Bedrock providers ([#119](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code/pull/119)).
- Added workflow state receipt routing so skill state writes emit a structured `WorkflowStateReceipt` envelope and sync skill-active HUD chips under `.gjc/state/skill-active-state.json` ([#118](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code/pull/118)).
- Made `gjc state`, `gjc ralplan`, and `gjc deep-interview` work natively as documented in their SKILL.md files. `gjc state read|write|clear|contract` operates directly on `.gjc/state/` receipts (accepts `--input '<json>'` with `@file` shorthand, `--mode <skill>`, positional `<skill>`, `--session-id`, `--thread-id`, `--turn-id`, `--json`, `--replace`); writes emit a structured `WorkflowStateReceipt` envelope and sync skill-active HUD chips. `gjc ralplan` accepts the documented `--interactive`/`--deliberate`/`--architect`/`--critic` flags and the `--write --stage --stage_n --artifact` artifact persistence shape under `.gjc/plans/ralplan/<run-id>/`. `gjc deep-interview` accepts the documented `--quick`/`--standard`/`--deep` resolution flags ([#125](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code/pull/125)).
- Added a GJC dogfood skill template ([#114](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code/pull/114)).

### Changed

- Changed `gjc --tmux` startup to create a fresh GJC-managed tmux session instead of attaching to an existing default session.
- Hardened team message delivery and worker enforcement ([#112](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code/pull/112)).
- Hardened team worker startup and evidence invariants ([#123](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code/pull/123)).
- Clarified team state while integration is pending ([#109](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code/pull/109)).
- Removed goal mode budget semantics ([#106](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code/pull/106)).
- Removed the unused `gjc question` CLI; the `ask` tool covers blocking-question prompts.
- Dropped the obsolete `loop` and `orchestrate` skills and pinned GJC skills in autocomplete ([#126](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code/pull/126)).
- Enforced CLI-managed workflow artifacts so planning skills persist via `gjc state` and `gjc ralplan --write` instead of editing `.gjc/` files directly.

### Fixed

- Fixed Anthropic extended-thinking replay recovery after aborted turns ([#115](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code/pull/115)).
- Fixed `gjc deep-interview` ambiguity threshold default so workflow gating matches the documented contract ([#116](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code/pull/116)).
- Fixed duplicate PR creation in the team integration path ([#117](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code/pull/117)).
- Fixed package asset resolution to prefer `GJC_PACKAGE_DIR` over the legacy `PI_PACKAGE_DIR`, preventing update-launch changelog displays from reading stale OMP package assets ([#111](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code/pull/111)).
## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed

- Added a `gjc skills` inspection command so installed binaries can list and read embedded workflow skills from any project without relying on source-tree `.gjc` files.
- Fixed first-run API provider onboarding so `models.yml` parent directories are created before writing, and malformed `/provicer` startup invocations now report the intended `/provider add` spelling instead of falling through to model bootstrap.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- Added scoped GJC tmux profile handling for `gjc --tmux` and `gjc team` sessions without mutating global tmux configuration.
- Added GJC team integration hardening for worker turn-end integration requests, auto-rebase/auto-merge conflict surfacing, protected checkpoint classification, and leader/worker-visible integration summaries.
- Added Node 20 release baseline validation to the release/check surface.

### Changed

- Clarified the public workflow contract so `deep-interview` and `ralplan` are invoked through `/skill:<name>`, while `gjc ultragoal` and `gjc team` remain native runtime commands.
- Updated the README hero image and Discord community invite.

### Fixed

- Restored Ultragoal completion receipt export/generation validation and completion gates.
- Fixed workflow bridge guidance and tests so private compatibility bridge commands are not advertised as public skill-loading paths.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-28

### Changed

- Released the current dev branch fixes with refreshed 0.1.3 package metadata.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-28

### Changed

- Updated package metadata for the Gajae Code npm publication.

### Fixed

- Fixed slash-command autocomplete so skill command matches no longer hide built-in fuzzy candidates like `/model` while typing `/mode`.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-28

### Changed

- Restored `gjc team` multi-worker GJC-team parity orchestration with current-window worker panes, GJC-scoped state/API semantics, and `N:agent-type` launches.
- Ported GJC team worker-worktree integration parity so `status`/`resume` auto-checkpoint dirty workers, merge or cherry-pick worker commits, cross-rebase idle workers, and record conflicts under `.gjc` integration artifacts.

### Added

- Added a detached `subagent` control tool for task subagents, with list, inspect, await-with-timeout, and cancel actions.
- Added shared provider onboarding for OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic-compatible API providers through `gjc setup provider` and `/provider add`, with model-list configuration and redacted setup feedback.
- Added shared `/model` onboarding guidance and an interactive `/provider` onboarding chooser so first launch, slash commands, and TUI no-model states point at the same provider setup flows.
- Added a native in-TUI skill HUD rail backed by `.gjc/state/skill-active-state.json`, so active GJC workflow skills are visible without a separate tmux pane.
- Added bundled `executor`, `architect`, `planner`, and `critic` role agents for task delegation, including source-defined prompt files and role-agent discovery coverage.
- Added a native `gjc team` runtime that writes GJC-scoped state, mailboxes, task lifecycle files, and telemetry without delegating to an external team binary
- Added `openai-code` and `gemini` to the web search provider settings so users can configure OpenAI and Gemini web search directly from provider selection
- Added OpenAI (`openai-code`) and Gemini web search options with updated setup descriptions for `gjc /login openai-code` and Gemini OAuth login

### Changed

- Changed normal `task` subagent launches to return immediately as detached background work while keeping generic `job` controls available.
- Changed default interactive `gjc` startup to enter a `gajae_code` tmux session before launching the Gajae Code TUI, with non-interactive modes continuing to run directly.
- Changed `/skill:<name>` handling so canonical skill invocations can be chained in one prompt across interactive and ACP sessions, with autocomplete-only `/name` and `/skill-name` normalization back to the public canonical form.
- Changed interactive `gjc` startup to launch tmux only when `--tmux` is provided, with direct startup as the default.
- Changed GJC default definitions so workflow skills remain source-bundled while repo-visible `.gjc` default artifacts are no longer the source of truth; updated system and Ultragoal guidance to use role-agent delegation and ralplan-first planning when needed.
- Changed bare `gjc setup` to install the normal default workflow skills, while keeping hooks, provider, Python, and speech-to-text setup as explicit optional components.
- Changed `gjc team` startup to use tmux worker panes backed by dedicated detached git worktrees by default, while keeping `--worktree` as a backward-compatible launch override.
- Constrained the visible GJC utility surface to the retained workflow/runtime endpoints and four bundled task agents, with MCP, arbitrary skill, plugin, extension, marketplace, and custom discovery surfaces quarantined from default public use.
- Redesigned the interactive TUI chrome with a minimal opencode-style prompt composer, simple user/gajae transcript labels, a forge-style welcome surface, and compact cwd/pulse indicators tuned for terminal coding-agent ergonomics.
- Changed web search provider credential lookup to use the shared `AuthStorage` pipeline (`getApiKey`/`getOAuthAccess`) for API-key and OAuth auth instead of direct `AgentStorage` access
- Changed the `openai-code` web search provider display label from `OpenAI code` to `OpenAI`
- Updated `anthropic` and `openai`/`gemini` web search option descriptions to reflect their native `web_search`/OAuth requirements
- Changed `/model` selection to a canonical single default-model action, removing the redundant role assignment menu for smol/slow/vision/plan/designer/commit/task models.
- Changed public API-compatible provider setup to require `--api-key-env` and reject raw `--api-key` values.

### Removed

- Removed approved non-critical slash-command handlers for plan, share, browser, copy, todo, changelog, context, branch, fork, handoff, force, and quit while keeping /loop, provider setup/login/logout/model selection, and SSH intact.
- Removed redundant model-selector role assignment options for smol, slow, vision, plan, designer, commit, task, and custom roles so selection uses one canonical default model.
- Removed obvious non-critical plugin, marketplace, extension, and reload-plugin slash-command handlers from the built-in registry while preserving ambiguous slash-command utilities for a later approval pass.
- Removed the auto-QA grievance reporting feature, including the `report_tool_issue` tool, `gjc grievances` command, auto-QA settings/env flags, sharing consent prompt, bundled push endpoint, and persistent install ID correlation path.
- Removed standalone utility feature documentation for plugins, extensions, hooks, marketplace, arbitrary skills, custom tools, task-agent discovery, and TUI/config utility internals from the generated docs index.

### Fixed

- Fixed `gjc ultragoal create-goals` native goal activation so live sessions receive a pending reconciliation request even when the session file already contains an active goal.
- Made `gjc ultragoal` run natively, preserving active goal state across interrupted turns.
- Fixed interactive Escape/interrupt recovery so abort cleanup is bounded and forces the session back to idle when a provider stream, tool, or post-turn task ignores cooperative cancellation.
- Fixed root `gjc --worktree` / `gjc -w` startup so the launch command actually creates and enters the sibling `<repo>.gajae-code-worktrees/<branch-slug>` git worktree before starting the session, using collision-resistant branch slugs and avoiding worktree side effects for help/version launches.
- Fixed root `gjc --worktree <branch>` / `gjc -w <branch>` parsing so named branch worktrees create their own `<branch-slug>` directory instead of reusing the dirty detached worktree for the current branch.
- Wired GJC native UserPromptSubmit/Stop skill-state hooks, including `gjc setup hooks`, so public workflow keywords activate `.gjc/state`, active skill state can block premature Stop events, and active Ultragoal sessions remind steering prompts to use `gjc ultragoal steer`.
- Fixed `gjc ultragoal create-goals` to seed GJC goal mode runtime state automatically, avoiding a separate manual `/goal` setup step.
- Fixed legacy Pi plugin import remapping and stale GJC config-path tests so rebranded `.gjc` discovery contracts pass while preserving legacy compatibility.
- Fixed web search OAuth-backed providers (including OpenAI code and Gemini) to use broker-managed token retrieval and account metadata, avoiding direct token-store refresh behavior that could cause search authentication failures
- Updated Tavily missing-credential feedback to prompt users to configure an API-key provider setting instead of referencing `agent.db` directly
- Refreshed expired OpenAI code provider OAuth tokens during `web_search` execution and persisted the updated credentials so searches continue working after token expiry
- Wired `/login`, `/logout`, `/model`, and `/provider` TUI slash commands through interactive provider/model selectors and existing OAuth flows.
