## New in 0.7.0

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/telegram-mobile-hero.png" alt="Gajae Code 0.7.0 mobile answers for coding agents hero illustration" width="100%" />
</p>

**Mobile answers for coding agents** — Gajae-Code now ships a configure-once notifications SDK and managed Telegram reference daemon. Each session exposes a loopback WebSocket discovery file and a generic `action_needed`/`reply` protocol so Telegram, Discord, Slack, mobile apps, or local tools can surface pending asks and route answers back without terminal scraping.

The bundled Telegram flow adds a threaded per-session surface with context updates, live/finalized output, image attachments, inline buttons, free-text replies, typing indicators, and double-check acknowledgements. `gjc daemon` keeps one safe long-poll owner per bot token so new sessions attach cleanly instead of tripping Telegram 409 conflicts.

## Also new in 0.6.0

  <img src="assets/rlm.png" alt="rlm research/REPL mode — Research. Experiment. Iterate." width="100%" />
</p>

**`rlm`** — an opt-in research/REPL mode. A Jupyter-notebook-style research session over the agent loop, backed by the shared persistent Python kernel with a hard-gated `python` + `read` + `web_search` toolset. Runs aggregate into `.gjc/rlm/<session>/notebook.ipynb` and synthesize a `report.md` on exit. Start it with `gjc rlm`.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/computer-use.png" alt="computer-use desktop control — See. Click. Type. Control." width="100%" />
</p>

**`computer-use`** — an experimental, opt-in desktop-control tool surface. Backed by native screenshot/input bindings and gated through settings/tool registration, it lets the agent see the screen and drive mouse/keyboard for local desktop coordination.

## What is Gajae-Code?

Gajae-Code (`gjc`) is an external coding-agent harness. It runs from the repository or worktree you choose, then gives the agent a small, explicit workflow surface:

```text
deep-interview -> ralplan -> ultragoal
                         └─ optional team execution when parallel tmux workers help
```

It is intentionally not a hidden plugin for Codex CLI, Claude Code, OpenCode, or Claw Code. Start `gjc` beside those tools when you want structured planning, persistent evidence, tmux-backed workers, or an isolated worktree.

## Install

```sh
bun install -g gajae-code
```

The scoped package is also available as `@gajae-code/coding-agent`.

### Supported platforms

Prebuilt standalone release binaries are published only for:

- **Linux** — x64 and arm64
- **Windows** — x64
- **macOS** — Apple Silicon (arm64) and Intel (x64)

The npm/Bun package path and build-from-source also remain available on every platform.

### macOS Intel install

Standalone release binaries are published for both Apple Silicon (`gjc-darwin-arm64`) and Intel (`gjc-darwin-x64`) macOS. You can also install through the npm/Bun package path or build from source:

```sh
bun install -g gajae-code
# or
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- --source
```

### Windows (native install)

On a clean Windows 11 machine, install Bun first, then install `gjc` with Bun's
global installer:

```powershell
# 1. Install Bun
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1|iex"

# 2. Restart the terminal so PATH and the Bun runtime refresh, then confirm Bun
bun --version

# 3. Install and verify gjc
bun install -g gajae-code
gjc --version
gjc --smoke-test
```

`bun install -g` places the `gjc` launcher in `%USERPROFILE%\.bun\bin`. That
directory must be on `PATH` for `gjc` to resolve as a command. Bun's installer
adds it automatically, but the change only applies to terminals started after
installation — restart PowerShell (or sign out/in) if `gjc` is "not recognized".

Troubleshooting:

- **`gjc` reports an old Bun runtime.** Re-run the Bun installer above, restart
  the terminal, and confirm `bun --version` matches what `gjc --version`
  expects. If an older Bun still wins, make sure `%USERPROFILE%\.bun\bin` is
  first on `PATH` and remove any stale Bun installs shadowing it.
- **`gjc.exe` exists but `gjc` is "not recognized".** The launcher is installed
  but not on `PATH`. Confirm `%USERPROFILE%\.bun\bin` is listed in
  `echo $env:Path`, then restart the terminal.
- **`gjc --tmux` starts without a tmux-backed session.** Native Windows needs a
  tmux-compatible executable on `PATH`. For GJC-managed session/team guarantees,
  use WSL with real tmux, or another provider that round-trips tmux user options
  such as `@gjc-profile`. Native psmux can provide `tmux`/`pmux`/`psmux`
  commands, but that path is not fully supported for GJC ownership tags and team
  guarantees yet; see `docs/environment-variables.md#interactive---tmux-startup-and-scrollmouse-profile`.

## Quick start

```sh
# Run directly in the current checkout
gjc

# Use a tmux-backed leader session
gjc --tmux

# Use an isolated worktree for risky or reviewable work
# --worktree takes an optional branch-like name, not a filesystem path.
gjc --tmux --worktree my-task-branch

# If you already created a worktree directory, launch from that directory instead.
cd ../my-task-worktree && gjc --tmux
```

### Image input

GJC accepts images in two ways:

- **CLI startup**: prefix a local image path with `@`, for example `gjc @screenshot.png "What should I change?"`.
- **Interactive TUI**: copy an image to the system clipboard and use the configured **Paste image from clipboard** key (Ctrl+V on Linux/macOS, Alt+V on Windows), or type `#paste-image` and choose the prompt action. When the clipboard is unavailable, paste or pass the image file path with `@path/to/image.png` instead.

Inside a GJC session, use the public workflow surface:

```text
/skill:deep-interview clarify ambiguous requirements
/skill:ralplan build and critique the implementation plan
gjc ultragoal create-goals --brief-file <approved-plan>
gjc ultragoal complete-goals
```

Add `gjc team ...` only when coordinated tmux workers materially help.

## Core capabilities

- **Interview before guessing**: `deep-interview` turns vague requests into concrete requirements.
- **Plan before mutation**: `ralplan` reviews the approach before code changes.
- **Execute with evidence**: `ultragoal` tracks goals, revisions, checks, and completion evidence.
- **Parallelize when useful**: `team` coordinates tmux-backed workers for larger tasks.
- **Stay external and reviewable**: run from a chosen repo or worktree without patching another agent runtime.

## Workflow surface

Gajae-Code ships four default workflow skills:

| Skill            | What it does                                                          |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `deep-interview` | Clarifies ambiguous requirements before planning or code changes.     |
| `ralplan`        | Builds and critiques an implementation plan before mutation.          |
| `ultragoal`      | Tracks goals through execution, revision, verification, and evidence. |
| `team`           | Coordinates tmux-backed workers when parallel execution is worth it.  |

And four bundled role agents:

| Agent       | What it does                                       |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `executor`  | Bounded implementation, fixes, and refactors.      |
| `architect` | Read-only architecture and code-review assessment. |
| `planner`   | Read-only sequencing and acceptance criteria.      |
| `critic`    | Read-only plan critique and actionability review.  |

No sprawling default skill zoo: GJC improves by making this small method better.

### Skill migration and bundled skill inspection

When moving a workflow into GJC, inspect the bundled defaults before installing or overwriting anything:

```sh
gjc skills list
gjc skills read ralplan
gjc setup defaults --check
```

`gjc setup defaults` installs the four bundled GJC workflow skills into your user `.gjc` directory and preserves existing local files by default. If `--check` reports missing or different files, compare the embedded copy with `gjc skills read <name>` first; use `gjc setup defaults --force` only when you intentionally want to replace local default workflow skill files.

## Works beside your existing agent or bot

| Tool or bot | Recommended GJC command | Boundary |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | -------- |
| Codex CLI | `gjc --tmux --worktree <name>` or `gjc` | `--worktree` names a GJC-managed sibling worktree; for an existing path, `cd` there first. |
| Claude Code | `gjc --tmux` or `gjc --tmux --worktree <name>` | GJC does not become a Claude Code extension. |
| OpenCode | `gjc` or `gjc --tmux` | External-runner workflow only today. |
| Claw Code | `gjc --tmux --worktree <name>` | GJC does not install into or replace Claw Code. |
| External controller / bot | `gjc --mode rpc` for a subprocess worker, or Bridge/HTTPS surfaces where configured | External controllers drive GJC through generic RPC/bridge contracts, not scrollback scraping. |

## Configuration

Provider retry budgets live in `~/.gjc/config.yml`:

```yaml
retry:
  requestMaxRetries: 4
  streamMaxRetries: 100
  maxRetries: 3
  maxDelayMs: 300000
```

`requestMaxRetries` applies before a stream is established. `streamMaxRetries` applies only to replay-safe transient stream failures. Invalid auth, unsupported models/providers, malformed requests, context overflow, user aborts, and permanent quota failures remain fail-fast.

### Good to read together

- [GJC multivendor setup guide](https://github.com/project820/gjc-multivendor-setup-guide) — a community guide for role-based provider/profile selection across Anthropic, OpenAI/Codex, Google/Gemini, xAI/Grok, and opencode-go. Treat its presets as user-level configuration guidance rather than bundled defaults; verify model availability and provider auth in your own environment before adopting them.

## TUI identity

The default dark TUI identity is the GJC red-claw theme, while light-appearance terminals default to the bundled blue-crab theme. Three additional bundled migration themes — `claude-code`, `codex`, and `opencode` — mirror the look of those tools for easy eye-migration and are selectable from Settings or `/theme`. Explicit user theme settings still win.

### Bundled theme grid

Pick from Settings (`Appearance -> Dark theme` / `Light theme`) or `/theme`.

| Theme | Visual feel | Best fit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `red-claw` | Dark GJC default with warm red-claw accents and strong status contrast. | Native GJC identity for dark terminals. |
| `blue-crab` | Bright-terminal blue palette tuned for readable light slots. | Light terminal or OS appearance. |
| `claude-code` | Claude Code-inspired dark palette with terracotta and pink highlights. | Claude Code muscle memory without leaving GJC. |
| `codex` | Crisp dark blue-gray palette with sharper coding-session contrast. | A Codex-like dark workspace. |
| `opencode` | OpenCode-inspired dark palette with punchier terminal accents. | OpenCode muscle memory in the bundled picker. |

## Development

Install dependencies, build native bindings, and set up local defaults:

```sh
bun install
bun run build:native
bun run install:defaults
```

The `.node` binary for `@gajae-code/natives` is gitignored and required before any CLI invocation (`install:defaults`, `dev:link`, tests).

### Canonical: build and link the dev `gjc`

To make the global `gjc` command run **this checkout's TypeScript source** (hot to every edit, with skills/natives working), link it onto your `PATH`:

```sh
bun install
bun run dev:link
```

`dev:link` symlinks `gjc` → `packages/coding-agent/src/cli.ts` into `~/.local/bin` (override with `GJC_DEV_LINK_DIR`), replaces that managed target, warns and fails if another `gjc` still shadows it earlier on `PATH`, and runs `--smoke-test` to confirm `@gajae-code/natives` loads. Use `bun run install:dev` for the full bootstrap (install + link + `setup defaults`).

Check at any time whether your `gjc` has drifted (wrong source, or a compiled binary that can't load skills):

```sh
bun run dev:doctor
```

> Do **not** use the compiled binary for day-to-day development. `bun --cwd=packages/coding-agent run build` produces a standalone `dist/gjc`, but a `bun build --compile` binary cannot dynamically load `@gajae-code/natives`, so skills fail with `Cannot find module '@gajae-code/natives' from '/$bunfs/root/gjc'`. Running from source via `dev:link` avoids this. Build the binary only when validating a release.

Run the CLI from source directly without linking:

```sh
bun packages/coding-agent/src/cli.ts --help
```

Default workflow definitions live in source, not committed `.gjc` copies:

```text
packages/coding-agent/src/defaults/gjc/skills/<name>/SKILL.md
packages/coding-agent/src/prompts/agents/<role>.md
```

For workflow-definition or rebrand-surface changes, run the project gates:

```sh
bun scripts/check-visible-definitions.ts
bun scripts/verify-g002-gates.ts
bun scripts/rebrand-inventory.ts --strict
bun test packages/coding-agent/test/default-gjc-definitions.test.ts
```

For future UI, dashboard, terminal, and TUI visual work, follow the repo-owned [UI design and visual QA workflow](docs/ui-design-visual-qa.md) before broad product-screen implementation.

## Inspirations and lineage

Gajae-Code's default TUI identity is the crustacean pair: red-claw for dark appearance and blue-crab for light appearance. It also bundles `claude-code`, `codex`, and `opencode` migration themes whose palettes are inspired by those tools so users moving from them get a familiar look. It builds on lessons from a small family of agent harnesses while keeping the public GJC surface intentionally focused. Historical attribution is kept in [`NOTICE.md`](NOTICE.md).
